## 🧠 What Are Biomedical Agent Skills?

Biomedical agent skills are structured, reusable research capabilities that can be used by:

- 👩‍🔬 Human researchers as guided workflows or analytical references  
- 🤖 AI agents as modular tools in automated research pipelines  

Each skill represents a focused biomedical task, such as data interpretation, literature reasoning, research structuring, or domain-specific analysis.

These skills are designed to make biomedical expertise **modular, shareable, and executable**.
