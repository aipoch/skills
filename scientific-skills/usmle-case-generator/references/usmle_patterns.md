# USMLE Question Patterns and Strategies

## Step 1 Question Patterns

### Mechanism-Based Questions
**Format**: "What is the most likely mechanism/pathophysiology?"

**Key Features**:
- Focus on underlying disease processes
- Require understanding of cellular/molecular mechanisms
- Often test enzyme deficiencies or receptor abnormalities

**Example**:
> A patient with hemolytic anemia and dark urine after eating fava beans...
> Question: What enzyme deficiency is responsible?
> Answer: Glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency

### Pharmacology Questions
**Format**: "What is the mechanism of action?" or "What is the most likely adverse effect?"

**Key Features**:
- Drug mechanisms at molecular level
- Side effect profiles
- Drug interactions
- Antidote knowledge

**Example**:
> A patient on chronic therapy for tuberculosis develops orange discoloration of bodily fluids...
> Question: Which medication causes this effect?
> Answer: Rifampin

### Microbiology Questions
**Format**: "What is the most likely causative organism?"

**Key Features**:
- Organism identification by:
  - Gram stain characteristics
  - Culture requirements
  - Toxin production
  - Disease associations
  - Environmental exposures

**Example**:
> A patient with lung abscess following dental aspiration...
> Question: What organism is most likely?
> Answer: Anaerobes (Fusobacterium, Prevotella, Peptostreptococcus)

### Genetics Questions
**Format**: "What is the mode of inheritance?" or "What is the risk to offspring?"

**Key Features**:
- Mendelian inheritance patterns
- Chromosomal abnormalities
- Trinucleotide repeat disorders
- Imprinting disorders

### Biochemistry Questions
**Format**: "What is the deficient enzyme?" or "What metabolic pathway is affected?"

**Key Features**:
- Enzyme deficiencies
- Metabolic pathway disruptions
- Accumulation of substrates/deficiency of products

## Step 2 CK Question Patterns

### Diagnosis Questions
**Format**: "What is the most likely diagnosis?"

**Approach**:
1. Identify key clinical features
2. Recognize pattern/syndrome
3. Eliminate distractors based on:
   - Atypical features
   - Missing key findings
   - Wrong demographics

**Red Flags for Common Diagnoses**:
- STEMI: Crushing substernal pain, diaphoresis, ST elevation
- Appendicitis: Migration of pain, RLQ tenderness, anorexia
- Pancreatitis: Epigastric pain radiating to back, elevated amylase/lipase
- DKA: Hyperglycemia, anion gap metabolic acidosis, ketones

### Next Best Step Questions
**Format**: "What is the most appropriate next step in management?"

**Priority Hierarchy**:
1. **Stabilize patient first** (ABCs)
   - Airway protection
   - Breathing support
   - Circulation/IV access

2. **Life-threatening conditions** (don't delay)
   - STEMI → PCI
   - Stroke → tPA (if eligible)
   - Sepsis → Antibiotics + fluids

3. **Definitive diagnosis** (when needed)
   - Gold standard tests
   - Biopsy for tissue diagnosis

4. **Initial screening** (when appropriate)
   - Best initial test (often less invasive)
   - Risk stratification

### Best Initial Test Questions
**Format**: "What is the best initial test?" or "What is the best initial step in diagnosis?"

**Characteristics of Best Initial Test**:
- High sensitivity
- Non-invasive or minimally invasive
- Cost-effective
- Guides further workup

**Examples**:
- Suspected PE with normal vitals → D-dimer
- Suspected DVT → Compression ultrasound
- Suspected MI → ECG + troponins
- Suspected pneumonia → Chest X-ray

### Most Accurate Test Questions
**Format**: "What is the most accurate test?" or "What is the gold standard?"

**Characteristics**:
- Highest sensitivity AND specificity
- May be invasive
- Definitive diagnosis

**Examples**:
- PE → CTPA (CT pulmonary angiography)
- Coronary artery disease → Cardiac catheterization
- GERD → 24-hour pH monitoring
- H. pylori → Endoscopy with biopsy

### Treatment Questions
**Format**: "What is the most appropriate treatment?" or "What is the drug of choice?"

**Key Considerations**:
1. First-line therapy (usually correct answer)
2. Contraindications in vignette
3. Patient factors (pregnancy, renal function, allergies)
4. Severity of condition

**Common First-Line Treatments**:
- HTN (general): Thiazide diuretic
- Type 2 DM: Metformin
- Community-acquired pneumonia: Macrolide or doxycycline
- H. pylori: Triple therapy (PPI + clarithromycin + amoxicillin)

## Answer Choice Patterns

### The "Next Step" Traps
**Wrong answers often include**:
- Tests that are too invasive for initial screening
- Treatments before diagnosis is confirmed
- Watchful waiting for serious conditions
- Secondary prevention when primary treatment needed

### The "Most Likely" Distractors
**Common wrong answers**:
- Rare presentations of common diseases
- Common presentations of rare diseases (when classic presentation fits)
- Conditions with similar symptoms but wrong demographics
- Partial matches missing key features

### The "EXCEPT" Questions
**Strategy**:
- Three answers are true/correct
- One is false/incorrect
- Read carefully - "EXCEPT" is easy to miss
- Often tests contraindications or adverse effects

## Clinical Reasoning Strategies

### 1. Identify the Diagnosis First
Before answering, be confident in the diagnosis:
- What is the classic triad/presentation?
- Do all features fit?
- What doesn't fit (rule out)?

### 2. Know Your Vital Signs
Abnormal vitals guide urgency:
- **Hypotension**: Think shock, sepsis, hemorrhage
- **Fever + hypotension**: Sepsis until proven otherwise
- **Tachycardia + hypoxia**: PE, pneumothorax, severe pneumonia
- **Hypertensive emergency**: >180/120 with end-organ damage

### 3. Laboratory Pattern Recognition
Common patterns to recognize:

| Pattern | Possible Causes |
|---------|-----------------|
| High BUN/Cr ratio (>20:1) | Prerenal azotemia |
| Low BUN/Cr ratio (<15:1) | ATN, low protein intake |
| Anion gap metabolic acidosis | DKA, lactic acidosis, renal failure, toxins |
| Respiratory alkalosis | Anxiety, PE, hypoxemia, early salicylate toxicity |
| Elevated amylase/lipase | Pancreatitis |
| Elevated troponin | MI, myocarditis, PE, renal failure |

### 4. Imaging Findings
Key patterns:
- **Air bronchograms**: Consolidation (pneumonia, pulmonary edema)
- **Kerley B lines**: CHF
- **Ground glass opacities**: PCP, ARDS, viral pneumonia
- **Westermark sign**: Pulmonary embolism (oligemia)
- **Hampton's hump**: Pulmonary infarction (wedge-shaped)

## Special Populations

### Pediatric Considerations
- Different vital sign normal ranges
- Developmental milestones
- Vaccination schedules
- Common pediatric conditions (RSV, croup, intussusception)

### Geriatric Considerations
- Atypical disease presentations
- Polypharmacy interactions
- Falls and functional assessment
- Delirium vs dementia

### Pregnancy Considerations
- Physiologic changes (anemia, elevated WBC)
- Contraindicated medications
- Pregnancy-specific conditions (preeclampsia, gestational diabetes)
- Radiation exposure concerns

## Time-Sensitive Emergencies

### The "Golden Windows"
- **STEMI**: Door-to-balloon <90 min, door-to-needle <30 min
- **Stroke**: tPA within 4.5 hours of symptom onset
- **Sepsis**: Antibiotics within 1 hour
- **Meningitis**: Antibiotics within 30 minutes

### Prioritization Rules
When multiple actions seem reasonable:
1. ABCs always come first
2. Don't let the test die (stabilize)
3. Treat life-threatening before diagnostic
4. Definitive therapy over supportive care

## Common USMLE Associations

## Question Analysis Checklist

Before selecting an answer:

1. ✓ What is the diagnosis?
2. ✓ Is the patient stable or unstable?
3. ✓ Is this an emergency?
4. ✓ What is being asked (diagnosis, next step, best test, treatment)?
5. ✓ Are there contraindications in the vignette?
6. ✓ Does the answer make sense with the patient's presentation?
7. ✓ Have I ruled out the distractors?

## Practice Tips

1. **Read the last line first** - Know what is being asked
2. **Generate answer before looking** - Prevents bias from options
3. **Don't add information** - Work only with what's given
4. **Watch for distractors** - Common conditions that "sort of" fit
5. **Know normal values** - Essential for interpretation
6. **Trust your instincts** - First answer is often correct
