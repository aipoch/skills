      "explanation": "Furosemide is the correct initial therapy for acute decompensated heart failure with volume overload. It provides rapid diuresis, reducing preload and relieving pulmonary congestion. While ACE inhibitors and beta-blockers are important for chronic management, diuresis is the priority in acute decompensation.",
