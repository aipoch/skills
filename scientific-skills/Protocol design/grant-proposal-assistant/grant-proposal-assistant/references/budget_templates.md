### Salary Calculation Formula

```
Requested Salary = Institutional Base Salary × % Effort
Benefits = Requested Salary × Fringe Benefit Rate
Total = Requested Salary + Benefits
```

### Animal Cost Calculation

```
Total Animal Cost = (Number of animals × Cost per animal) + (Number of animals × Days × Per diem)

Example: 100 mice for 1 year
- Purchase: 100 × $200 = $20,000
- Housing: 100 × 365 × $1 = $36,500
- Total: $56,500
```

### Notes

1. **Modular budgets**: NIH allows simplified budgets when direct costs ≤ $250,000/year
2. **Equipment**: Excluded from indirect cost base at many institutions
3. **Subcontracts**: First $25,000 of each subcontract subject to indirect costs
4. **Escalation**: Typically 3% per year for multi-year budgets
