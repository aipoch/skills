# NSF Standard Grant Template

## Overview
The National Science Foundation (NSF) funds research across all fields of science and engineering. Unlike NIH, NSF uses two merit review criteria: Intellectual Merit and Broader Impacts.

## Standard Sections

### 1. Cover Sheet (FastLane or Research.gov)
- Program selection
- Title
- PI/Co-PI information
- Requested amount and duration

### 2. Project Summary (1 page)
Must address BOTH review criteria:

#### Intellectual Merit
- How does the project advance knowledge?
- What is the potential for discovery?

#### Broader Impacts
- How will society benefit?
- Educational/training outcomes
- Diversity and inclusion
- Infrastructure development
- Public engagement

### 3. Project Description (15 pages maximum)

#### Content Requirements
- Clear statement of objectives
- Relationship to current state of knowledge
- Plan of work
- Expected significance

#### Required Elements
1. **Results from Prior NSF Support** (if applicable)
   - Up to 5 pages for PI
   - 1 page per Co-PI
   - Must report on previous NSF grants

2. **Research Methods**
   - Detailed procedures
   - Data analysis plans
   - Timeline

3. **Management Plan**
   - Coordination if multiple PIs
   - Student/postdoc supervision

#### Prohibited Content
- PI biographical information (goes in Bio Sketch)
- Budget details (goes in Budget Justification)
- Letters of collaboration in main text

### 4. References Cited
- No page limit
- Must be cited in Project Description
- Use consistent format

### 5. Biographical Sketches (2 pages each)
New NSF format (as of 2020):
- Professional Preparation
- Appointments
- Products (most relevant 5)
- Synergistic Activities

### 6. Budget and Budget Justification
- Direct costs by category
- Indirect costs
- Subawards
- Multi-year breakdown

### 7. Current and Pending Support
All PIs and Co-PIs must report:
- Active grants
- Pending proposals
- Time commitments

### 8. Facilities, Equipment and Other Resources
- Institutional resources
- Available equipment
- Laboratory space
- Computational resources

### 9. Special Information (as applicable)
- Postdoctoral Mentoring Plan
- Data Management Plan
- Letters of Collaboration
- RUI certification (for undergraduate institutions)

## Review Criteria

### Intellectual Merit (Weighted Equally)
- Potential to advance knowledge
- Qualifications of proposer
- Creativity and originality
- Sound research plan
- Adequate resources

### Broader Impacts (Weighted Equally)
- STEM education advancement
- Public understanding of science
- Underrepresented group participation
- Enhanced infrastructure
- Societal outcomes

## Review Process

1. **Ad hoc reviewers**: 3-10 external experts
2. **Panel review**: Program-specific panel discussion
3. **Program officer**: Makes recommendation
4. **Division director**: Final decision

## Rating Scale
- **Excellent**: Highest rating, ready to fund
- **Very Good**: High quality, minor concerns
- **Good**: Competent, some concerns
- **Fair**: Significant deficiencies
- **Poor**: Major weaknesses

## Program-Specific Requirements

### CAREER Awards
- Integrated research and education
- Minimum 5-year duration
- Eligibility: untenured faculty

### CRII (Computer and Information Science and Engineering Research Initiation Initiative)
- New PhD faculty
- Smaller awards
- Single investigator

### MRI (Major Research Instrumentation)
- Equipment-focused
- Shared-use required
- Cost-sharing required

## Common Mistakes

1. **Weak broader impacts** - Treated as afterthought
2. **Insufficient innovation** - Incremental research
3. **Unrealistic scope** - Too much for timeline
4. **Poor integration** - Research and education disconnected
5. **Missing DMP** - Data management plan inadequate
6. **Budget errors** - Mismatched amounts
7. **Formatting issues** - Exceeding page limits

## Timeline

- **Preliminary proposals** (for some programs): March-May
- **Full proposals**: Varies by program (Oct-Nov common)
- **Review**: 4-6 months
- **Decision**: Variable, often 6-9 months
- **Start date**: Typically following academic year
