# Patent Claim Mapper

## Purpose
Analyze patent claim texts to identify potential infringement risk points, support competitive analysis and Freedom to Operate (FTO) studies.

## Description
This tool is used to parse patent claim texts, extract key technical features, and compare them with target product/technology features to generate infringement risk assessment reports. Suitable for patent engineers, IP lawyers, and R&D teams for patent risk screening work.

## Features
1. **Claim Parsing** - Automatically identify independent and dependent claims
2. **Technical Feature Extraction** - Extract key limiting words and technical elements
3. **Infringement Comparison Analysis** - Map and compare claims with product features
4. **Risk Rating** - High/Medium/Low three-level risk rating
5. **Visualized Report** - Generate structured risk analysis reports

## Installation
No additional installation required, Python standard library is sufficient.

## Configuration
Create `config.json` in the run directory:
```json
{
  "risk_threshold": 0.7,
  "output_format": "markdown",
  "language": "zh",
  "detailed_analysis": true
}
```

## Usage

### Command Line
```bash
# Analyze single patent file
python scripts/main.py analyze --patent claims.txt --product product_spec.txt

# Batch analysis
python scripts/main.py analyze --patent-dir ./patents/ --product product_spec.txt

# Only parse claim structure
python scripts/main.py parse --patent claims.txt
```

### Python API
```python
from scripts.main import PatentClaimMapper

mapper = PatentClaimMapper()

# Load claims
claims = mapper.load_claims("patent_claims.txt")

# Analyze infringement risk
result = mapper.analyze_infringement(
    claims=claims,
    product_features=["feature1", "feature2"]
)

# Generate report
report = mapper.generate_report(result)
```

## Input Format

### Patent Claim Format
```
1. A [device/method], comprising:
   [technical feature A];
   [technical feature B]; and
   [technical feature C].

2. The [device/method] of claim 1, wherein [additional feature D].
```

### Product Feature Description Format
```
- Feature 1: [description]
- Feature 2: [description]
Or free text description
```

## Output Format

### Risk Assessment Report Structure
```markdown
# Patent Infringement Risk Analysis Report

## Basic Information
- Analysis Date: 2024-XX-XX
- Patent Identifier: [Patent No./Name]
- Target Product: [Product Name]

## Risk Overview
| Claim | Risk Level | Match Rate |
|---------|---------|-------|
| Claim 1 | 🔴 High Risk | 85% |
| Claim 2 | 🟡 Medium Risk | 60% |

## Detailed Analysis
### Claim 1
- Technical feature mapping table
- Infringement analysis explanation
- Design-around suggestions
```

## Risk Levels
- 🔴 **High Risk**: Match rate ≥ 70%, substantial infringement possibility exists
- 🟡 **Medium Risk**: Match rate 40-69%, further evaluation needed
- 🟢 **Low Risk**: Match rate < 40%, infringement possibility is low

## Limitations
1. Based on text similarity analysis, does not constitute legal advice
2. Cannot replace professional patent attorney's infringement determination
3. Requires manual verification of technical feature equivalence judgment
4. Only supports Chinese and English claim texts

## Dependencies
- Python 3.8+
- No third-party dependencies (uses standard library)

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Indicator | Assessment | Level |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Code Execution | Python/R scripts executed locally | Medium |
| Network Access | No external API calls | Low |
| File System Access | Read input files, write output files | Medium |
| Instruction Tampering | Standard prompt guidelines | Low |
| Data Exposure | Output files saved to workspace | Low |

## Security Checklist
