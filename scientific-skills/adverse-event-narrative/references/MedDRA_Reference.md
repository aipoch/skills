- PT: Dyspepsia

### 3. Nervous System Disorders
- PT: Headache
- PT: Dizziness
- PT: Tremor
- PT: Syncope
- PT: Seizure
- PT: Paraesthesia

### 4. Skin and Subcutaneous Tissue Disorders
- PT: Rash
- PT: Pruritus
- PT: Urticaria
- PT: Erythema
- PT: Hyperhidrosis
- PT: Stevens-Johnson syndrome

### 5. Investigations (Laboratory Abnormalities)
- PT: Alanine aminotransferase increased
- PT: Aspartate aminotransferase increased
- PT: Blood creatinine increased
- PT: White blood cell count decreased
- PT: Platelet count decreased

### 6. Cardiac Disorders
- PT: Palpitations
- PT: Tachycardia
- PT: Bradycardia

## Seriousness Criteria Terms

## Severity Assessment

| Level | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Mild | Transient symptoms, no intervention needed |
| Moderate | Some intervention required, affects daily activities |
| Severe | Significant intervention required, unable to perform daily activities |

## Coding Tips

1. Use the most specific PT available
2. Code the event as reported by the reporter, not your interpretation
3. Multiple PTs may be needed for complex events
4. Include LLT (Lowest Level Terms) if specific diagnosis not confirmed
5. Update coding as more information becomes available
