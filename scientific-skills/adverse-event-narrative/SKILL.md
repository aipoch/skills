# Adverse Event Narrative Generator

Generate CIOMS-compliant adverse event narratives for Individual Case Safety Report (ICSR) submissions.

## Overview

This skill creates structured, medically accurate narratives that meet international pharmacovigilance standards (CIOMS I, ICH E2B R3). The narrative synthesizes patient demographics, medical history, concomitant medications, suspect product details, adverse events, and outcome information into a standardized format suitable for regulatory reporting.

## Use Cases

- Draft ICSR narratives for regulatory submissions
- Convert raw case data into CIOMS-compliant text
- Standardize adverse event documentation across teams
- Prepare safety reports for health authorities
- Generate case summaries for signal detection

## Input Requirements

### Required Fields

| Field | Description | Format |
|-------|-------------|--------|
| `case_id` | Unique case identifier | String |
| `patient_age` | Patient age at event | Number + unit (years/months) |
| `patient_sex` | Biological sex | Male/Female/Unknown |
| `suspect_drugs` | Suspected medications | Array of drug objects |
| `adverse_events` | Reported reactions | Array of MedDRA PT terms |

### Drug Object Structure

```json
{
  "drug_name": "Brand/Generic name",
  "indication": "Medical condition treated",
  "dose": "Dosage amount",
  "frequency": "Dosing frequency",
  "route": "Administration route",
  "start_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "stop_date": "YYYY-MM-DD or ongoing",
  "lot_number": "Batch/lot number (if known)"
}
```

### Optional Fields

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `medical_history` | Significant pre-existing conditions |
| `concomitant_drugs` | Other medications at time of event |
| `diagnostic_tests` | Lab results, imaging, procedures |
| `dechallenge` | Effect after suspect drug withdrawal |
| `rechallenge` | Effect after re-administration |
| `outcome` | Final status (recovered/fatal/ongoing) |
| `causality` | Reporter's causality assessment |

## Output Format

The generated narrative follows CIOMS I standard sections:

1. **Patient Demographics** - Age, sex, relevant characteristics
2. **Medical History** - Significant past conditions
3. **Suspect Drug(s)** - Details of medication(s) in question
4. **Adverse Event** - Detailed description of reaction(s)
5. **Diagnostic Results** - Relevant test findings
6. **Treatment** - Medical management of the event
7. **Outcome** - Final patient status
8. **Causality Assessment** - Reporter's opinion on relationship

## Usage

```python
python scripts/main.py --input case_data.json --output narrative.txt
```

### JSON Input Example

      "value": "8.5 mmol/L",
      "reference_range": "0.5-2.2 mmol/L",
      "date": "2024-01-29"
    }
  ],
  "dechallenge": "Positive - lactate normalized after discontinuation",

}
```

## Technical Notes

**Difficulty:** High ⚠️

This skill requires:
- Medical domain knowledge for accurate terminology
- Understanding of pharmacovigilance regulations
- Temporal relationship assessment
- MedDRA coding awareness
- Causality evaluation principles

**Limitations:**
- Does not replace qualified healthcare professional review
- Requires verification of medical facts
- Causality assessment is based on reporter input, not independent evaluation
- Temporal associations do not establish causation
