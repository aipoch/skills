# Automated SOAP Note Generator

## Overview

Converts unstructured clinical input (dictation, rough notes, or transcripts) into professionally formatted SOAP notes compliant with medical documentation standards.

## Function

**Primary Use Cases:**
- Convert physician dictation to structured SOAP format
- Transform consultation rough notes into clinical documentation
- Generate standardized encounter summaries from audio transcripts
- Reduce administrative burden for healthcare providers

**Input Types Supported:**
- Raw clinical dictation text
- Unstructured consultation notes
- Audio-to-text transcripts
- Patient encounter descriptions

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```python
from scripts.main import SOAPNoteGenerator

generator = SOAPNoteGenerator()
soap_note = generator.generate(
    input_text="Patient presents with 2-day history of chest pain...",
    patient_id="P12345"
)
```

### Command Line

```bash
python scripts/main.py --input "Patient reports headache..." --output soap_note.md
```

### With Audio Input

```python
soap_note = generator.generate_from_audio(
    audio_path="consultation.wav",
    patient_id="P12345"
)
```

## Output Format

**SOAP Structure:**

| Section | Content |
|---------|---------|
| **S** - Subjective | Patient-reported symptoms, history, complaints |
| **O** - Objective | Physical exam findings, vital signs, test results |
| **A** - Assessment | Clinical impression, differential diagnosis |
| **P** - Plan | Treatment plan, medications, follow-up instructions |

## Parameters

| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `input_text` | str | Yes* | Raw clinical text to parse |
| `audio_path` | str | Yes* | Path to audio file for transcription |
| `patient_id` | str | No | Patient identifier |
| `encounter_date` | str | No | Date of encounter (ISO 8601) |
| `provider` | str | No | Healthcare provider name |

*Either `input_text` or `audio_path` required

## Technical Approach

### Core NLP Pipeline

1. **Medical Entity Recognition**: Identify symptoms, diagnoses, medications, procedures
2. **Section Classification**: Classify sentences into S/O/A/P categories
3. **Temporal Extraction**: Parse timeline information (onset, duration, frequency)
4. **Negation Detection**: Distinguish positive from negative findings
5. **Relation Extraction**: Link findings to body parts, severity, timing

### NLP Techniques

- **Named Entity Recognition (NER)**: Medical terminology extraction
- **Dependency Parsing**: Understanding relationships between medical concepts
- **Text Classification**: Sentence-level S/O/A/P categorization
- **Template Filling**: Structured output generation

### Difficulty Level: HIGH

⚠️ **Technical Complexity**: This skill requires:
- Medical domain NLP expertise
- Understanding of clinical terminology
- Handling ambiguous clinical language
- Compliance with medical documentation standards

**Status**: Requires human review for clinical accuracy.

## Limitations

- Not a substitute for clinical judgment
- Requires healthcare provider review before use in patient records
- Accuracy depends on input quality and clarity
