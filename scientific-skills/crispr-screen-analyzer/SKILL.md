# CRISPR Screen Analyzer

Process CRISPR screening data to identify essential genes and hit candidates.

## Usage

```bash
python scripts/main.py --counts counts.txt --samples samplesheet.csv --output results/
```

## Parameters

- `--counts`: sgRNA count matrix
- `--samples`: Sample annotation file
- `--control`: Control sample names
- `--treatment`: Treatment sample names
- `--method`: Analysis method (MAGeCK/BAGEL/RRA)

## Analysis Features

- Quality control metrics
- Essential gene identification
- Hit candidate ranking
- Pathway enrichment
- Visualization

## Output

- Gene-level statistics
- sgRNA-level results
- Essential gene lists
- QC plots

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Indicator | Assessment | Level |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Code Execution | Python/R scripts executed locally | Medium |
| Network Access | No external API calls | Low |
| File System Access | Read input files, write output files | Medium |
| Instruction Tampering | Standard prompt guidelines | Low |
| Data Exposure | Output files saved to workspace | Low |

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] No unauthorized file system access (../)
- [ ] Output does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Prompt injection protections in place
- [ ] Input file paths validated (no ../ traversal)
- [ ] Output directory restricted to workspace
- [ ] Script execution in sandboxed environment
- [ ] Error messages sanitized (no stack traces exposed)
- [ ] Dependencies audited
## Prerequisites

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### Success Metrics
- [ ] Successfully executes main functionality
- [ ] Output meets quality standards
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully
- [ ] Performance is acceptable

### Test Cases
1. **Basic Functionality**: Standard input → Expected output
2. **Edge Case**: Invalid input → Graceful error handling
3. **Performance**: Large dataset → Acceptable processing time

## Lifecycle Status

- **Current Stage**: Draft
- **Next Review Date**: 2026-03-06
- **Known Issues**: None
- **Planned Improvements**: 
  - Performance optimization
  - Additional feature support
