# Response Tone Polisher: Before & After Examples

## Example 1: Direct Refusal

### Reviewer Comment
> The authors should completely rewrite the Introduction to focus on mechanism X rather than mechanism Y.

### Before (Defensive)
```
I will not rewrite the Introduction. Our paper is about mechanism Y, not 
mechanism X. The reviewer is wrong to suggest this change.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have carefully considered this 
recommendation and respectfully maintain our original focus on mechanism Y, 
as this is the central contribution of our study. However, to acknowledge 
the importance of mechanism X, we have added a comparative discussion of 
both mechanisms in the revised Introduction (Page 2, Lines 45-60).

## Example 2: Sample Size Criticism

### Reviewer Comment
> The sample size of n=30 is too small to draw any meaningful conclusions.

### Before (Defensive)
```
The reviewer is incorrect. Our sample size is standard for this type of 
study. Smith et al. (2020) used only 25 subjects. We already explained 
this in the Methods section.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We appreciate the reviewer's concern regarding sample size. We acknowledge 
that larger samples provide greater statistical power. Our sample size 
of n=30 was determined through a priori power analysis (80% power to detect 
an effect size of d=0.5 at α=0.05), and is consistent with established 
conventions in this field (Smith et al., 2020; Jones et al., 2021). To 
address this concern, we have added a dedicated paragraph discussing power 
analysis and sample size justification to the Methods section (Page 4, 
Lines 112-125) and have expanded the Limitations section accordingly 
(Page 8, Lines 220-230).

## Example 3: Methodology Challenge

### Reviewer Comment
> The authors should use Method A instead of Method B for the statistical analysis.

### Before (Defensive)
```
We disagree. Method B is better for our data. This is unnecessary.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. We have carefully 
evaluated Method A as an alternative approach. While Method A is indeed 
widely used and offers certain advantages, we respectfully maintain our 
use of Method B because [specific rationale based on data characteristics]. 
To acknowledge this alternative approach, we have added a comparative 
discussion of both methods in the revised Methods section (Page 5, Lines 
140-155) and have included sensitivity analyses using Method A in 
Supplementary Table 2.

## Example 4: Figure Criticism

### Reviewer Comment
> Figure 3 is unclear and should be removed.

### Before (Defensive)
```
Figure 3 is clear. The reviewer misunderstood it. We will not remove it.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We apologize for the lack of clarity in the original Figure 3. We have 
completely revised the figure with improved labeling, additional annotations, 
and a clearer legend to better convey the key findings. We believe this 
figure provides essential visual support for the main conclusion discussed 
in Section 4.2. The revised figure and caption can be found on Page 10.
```

## Example 5: Missing Citation

### Reviewer Comment
> The authors have failed to cite the seminal work by Johnson et al. (2019).

### Before (Defensive)
```
We already cited Johnson et al. in the Discussion. The reviewer missed it.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We thank the reviewer for highlighting this important reference. We have 
now prominently cited Johnson et al. (2019) in the Introduction (Page 1, 
Line 25) and have expanded our discussion of their findings in relation 
to our own results (Page 7, Lines 180-190).
```

## Example 6: Interpretation Disagreement

### Reviewer Comment
> The authors' interpretation of the data is not supported by the results.

### Before (Defensive)
```
Your interpretation is wrong. Our data clearly show our conclusion is correct.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We respectfully offer an alternative interpretation. Our conclusion is 
supported by [specific evidence from results]. We have added additional 
statistical analyses (Supplementary Figure 4) and have expanded our 
justification in the Discussion section (Page 9, Lines 245-260) to 
strengthen this interpretation.
```

## Example 7: Scope Limitation

### Reviewer Comment
> The authors should include experiments testing mechanism Z.

### Before (Defensive)
```
This is not possible. We don't have time or resources. This is beyond 
the scope.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We appreciate this suggestion for extending our analysis to mechanism Z. 
While we agree that investigating mechanism Z would be valuable, these 
experiments are beyond the scope of the current study, which focuses 
specifically on mechanisms X and Y. We have added a statement to the 
Discussion noting this as an important direction for future research 
(Page 10, Lines 280-285).
```

## Example 8: Statistical Concern

### Reviewer Comment
> The statistical tests used are inappropriate for this type of data.

### Before (Defensive)
```
We used the standard tests. The reviewer is incorrect.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We thank the reviewer for raising this important statistical concern. We 
have re-evaluated our choice of statistical tests and have consulted with 
a biostatistician. We confirm that our use of [test name] is appropriate 
for our data structure because [rationale]. However, to ensure robustness, 
we have additionally performed [alternative test] and find consistent 
results (reported in Supplementary Table 5). We have clarified our 
statistical approach in the Methods section (Page 6, Lines 165-175).
```

## Example 9: Writing Quality

### Reviewer Comment
> The writing is poor and needs significant editing throughout.

### Before (Defensive)
```
We believe the writing is adequate. This is unnecessary.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We thank the reviewer for this feedback. We have engaged a professional 
scientific editor to thoroughly revise the manuscript for clarity, 
concision, and readability. Major revisions include [brief summary of 
key changes]. We believe the manuscript is now substantially improved.
```

## Example 10: Control Group Question

### Reviewer Comment
> Why was no positive control included in the experiments?

### Before (Defensive)
```
We didn't need a positive control. Our results are clear without it.
```

### After (Polished)
```
We appreciate this important methodological suggestion. In our original 
design, we relied on [alternative validation approach] to ensure data 
quality. However, to strengthen the experimental rigor, we have now 
conducted additional experiments including positive controls, as 
suggested. These results confirm our original findings and are now 
included in Figure 2B and described in the Results section (Page 5, 
Lines 130-140).
