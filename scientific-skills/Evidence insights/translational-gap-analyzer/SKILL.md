# Translational Gap Analyzer

**ID**: 209

## Description

Assesses the "translational gap" between basic research models (such as mice, zebrafish, cell lines) and human diseases, providing early warning of clinical translation failure risks. This system helps researchers identify potential translational barriers in preclinical research and improve clinical trial success rates through multi-dimensional analysis.

## Capabilities

- Evaluates anatomical/physiological differences between models and humans
- Analyzes pathological similarity of disease models
- Identifies interspecies differences in molecular pathways
- Evaluates pharmacokinetic differences
- Provides early warning of clinical trial failure risk factors
- Provides improvement recommendations to increase translation success rates

## Usage

```bash
# Full assessment report
python scripts/main.py --model <model_type> --disease <disease_name> --full

# Quick risk assessment
python scripts/main.py --model <model_type> --disease <disease_name> --quick

# Compare multiple models
python scripts/main.py --models mouse,rat,primate --disease <disease_name> --compare

# Specify focus areas
python scripts/main.py --model mouse --disease "Alzheimer's" --focus metabolism,immune
```

## Arguments

| Argument | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `--model` | Model type (mouse, rat, zebrafish, cell_line, organoid, primate) | Yes (unless --models) |
| `--models` | Multi-model comparison mode, comma-separated | No |
| `--disease` | Disease name or MeSH ID | Yes |
| `--focus` | Focus areas, comma-separated (anatomy, physiology, metabolism, immune, genetics, behavior) | No |
| `--full` | Generate full assessment report | No |
| `--quick` | Quick risk assessment mode | No |
| `--compare` | Multi-model comparison mode | No |
| `--output` | Output file path | No |
| `--format` | Output format (json, markdown, table) | No |

## Model Types

### Common Models

| Model | Applicable Scenarios | Typical Gaps |
|------|----------|----------|
| mouse | Genetic manipulation, basic research | Immune, metabolism, brain structure |
| rat | Behavioral studies, cardiovascular | Cognition, drug metabolism |
| zebrafish | Development, high-throughput screening | Anatomy, physiology |
| cell_line | Molecular mechanisms | Microenvironment, systemic |
| organoid | Human-specific research | Maturity, vascularization |
| primate | Preclinical validation | Cost, ethics |

## Gap Scoring System

- **0-3**: Low gap, good translation prospects
- **4-6**: Moderate gap, requires additional validation
- **7-8**: High gap, significant translation risks exist
- **9-10**: Extremely high gap, low translation likelihood

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- Built-in libraries: argparse, json, sys

## Files

- `SKILL.md` - This file
- `scripts/main.py` - Main analysis script

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Indicator | Assessment | Level |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Code Execution | Python/R scripts executed locally | Medium |
| Network Access | No external API calls | Low |
