## Response Letter

Dear Editor and Reviewers,

Thank you for your constructive feedback on our manuscript titled "Multi-omics Integration Reveals Novel Biomarkers in Complex Disease" submitted to Nature Communications. We have carefully addressed all comments and revised the manuscript accordingly. Below is our point-by-point response to each reviewer's comments.

### Reviewer #1

**Comment 1:** The introduction should better motivate the clinical relevance of this study. The connection to current therapeutic challenges is not sufficiently clear.

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. We have significantly expanded the introduction to better motivate the clinical relevance of our study. Specifically, we have added a new paragraph discussing the current limitations of existing therapeutic approaches and how our biomarker discovery pipeline addresses these gaps (Page 2, Lines 45-62). We have also included recent statistics on disease burden to emphasize the urgency of improved diagnostic strategies.

**Comment 2:** The sample size (n=150) seems relatively small for a multi-omics study. Have the authors considered the statistical power limitations?

**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer for raising this important concern. We acknowledge that our sample size is modest compared to some recent large-scale studies. However, our power analysis (included in the revised Methods section) indicates that n=150 provides 80% power to detect effect sizes of d≥0.5 at α=0.05, which aligns with our primary findings. To address this concern, we have: (1) added a detailed power analysis (Page 4, Lines 88-95), (2) included a discussion of sample size limitations in the Discussion section (Page 12, Lines 280-290), and (3) validated our key findings in an independent cohort of n=75 samples (Page 6, Lines 145-155).

**Comment 3:** Figure 2 is difficult to interpret. The color scheme makes it hard to distinguish between groups.

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this observation. We have completely redrawn Figure 2 with an improved color palette that provides better contrast between groups. We have also added additional annotations and simplified the visualization by separating the most complex panel into two distinct panels for clarity. The revised figure caption now includes a more detailed explanation of the visualization approach (Page 7, Figure 2).

**Comment 4:** Have the authors considered the work by Smith et al. (2023) on similar biomarkers?

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for bringing this important reference to our attention. We were not aware of this recent publication during our initial submission. We have now cited Smith et al. (2023) in our introduction (Page 2, Line 38) and added a comparative discussion in our Discussion section (Page 11, Lines 250-265). Our biomarkers show partial overlap with those identified by Smith et al., but our multi-omics approach identifies additional candidates that were not reported in their transcriptome-only analysis.

### Reviewer #2

**Comment 1:** The statistical methodology for integrating multi-omics data is not clearly explained. The authors should provide more detail on the weighting scheme used.

**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion regarding the statistical methodology. We have expanded the Methods section to provide a more detailed explanation of our integration approach. Specifically, we have added: (1) a step-by-step description of the weighting algorithm, (2) the mathematical formulation of the integration function, and (3) a sensitivity analysis showing how results vary with different weighting parameters (Page 5, Lines 110-135, and new Supplementary Figure S3).

**Comment 2:** The authors claim their biomarkers have diagnostic potential, but no validation in an independent cohort is presented.

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this critical observation. We agree that independent validation is essential for establishing diagnostic potential. In the revised manuscript, we have included validation results from an independent cohort of n=75 samples that were not used in the discovery phase. The validation results support our primary findings with comparable sensitivity (0.82 vs 0.85) and specificity (0.79 vs 0.81) values. These results are now included in the revised Results section (Page 6, Lines 145-155) and as new Figure 4.

**Comment 3:** The discussion of limitations is too brief.

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this comment. We have substantially expanded the limitations section of our discussion. We now discuss: (1) sample size and generalizability constraints, (2) the need for prospective clinical validation, (3) potential batch effects in multi-omics data collection, and (4) the technical challenges of translating our findings to clinical assays (Page 12, Lines 275-300).

### Reviewer #3

**Comment 1:** The writing quality needs improvement. There are numerous grammatical errors throughout the manuscript.

**Response:** We apologize for the deficiencies in writing quality in the original submission. We have carefully edited the entire manuscript for grammar, clarity, and style. The revised manuscript has also been professionally proofread. We believe the writing is now of appropriate quality for publication.

**Comment 2:** Table 1 would be better presented as a figure.

**Response:** We appreciate the reviewer's suggestion. However, after careful consideration, we have retained Table 1 in its current format. The tabular presentation is more appropriate for the detailed clinical characteristics data, which includes multiple variables with different measurement scales. Converting to a figure would reduce information density and clarity. We have, however, reformatted Table 1 to improve readability with clearer column headers and additional footnotes (Page 8, Table 1).

**Comment 3:** The authors should provide the code for their analysis pipeline.

**Response:** We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggestion. We have deposited our analysis code in a GitHub repository (link provided in the Data Availability section, Page 14, Lines 340-345) and included detailed documentation for reproducibility. The repository includes all scripts for data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and figure generation.

We hope that our revisions satisfactorily address all the reviewers' concerns. We are grateful for the opportunity to improve our manuscript and believe it is now significantly stronger.

Sincerely,
