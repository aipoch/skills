# CPT (Current Procedural Terminology) Coding Guidelines

## Overview

CPT codes are maintained by the American Medical Association (AMA) and describe medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. They are used for billing and documentation across healthcare settings.

## CPT Code Categories

### Category I Codes
Standard five-digit codes for procedures and services:
- **00000-09999**: Anesthesia
- **10000-19999**: Surgery
- **20000-29999**: Surgery (continued)
- **30000-39999**: Surgery (continued)
- **40000-49999**: Surgery (continued)
- **50000-59999**: Surgery/HCI
- **60000-69999**: Surgery (continued)
- **70000-79999**: Radiology

### Category II Codes
Supplemental tracking codes for performance measurement (optional):
- Four digits + letter F
- Examples: 0001F-9007F

### Category III Codes
Temporary codes for emerging technologies:
- Four digits + letter T
- Examples: 0019T-0875T

## Compliance and Documentation

### Key Documentation Requirements

1. **Medical Necessity**: Service must be reasonable and necessary
2. **Covered Services**: Must be within scope of practice
3. **Accurate Coding**: Code to highest level of specificity
4. **Complete Documentation**: Support level of service reported

### Common Compliance Issues

1. **Upcoding**: Reporting higher level than documented
2. **Unbundling**: Billing separately for bundled services
3. **Double Billing**: Billing for same service twice
4. **Lack of Medical Necessity**: Service not justified
5. **Documentation Deficiencies**: Insufficient to support code

### National Correct Coding Initiative (NCCI)

**CCI Edits:**
- Column 1/Column 2 edits: Mutually exclusive or bundled
- Medically unlikely edits (MUE): Maximum units per day

**Modifiers for CCI Overrides:**
- Modifier 59: Distinct procedural service
