# USMLE Case Generator

Generate USMLE Step 1 and Step 2 CK style clinical cases for medical education and board exam preparation.

## Features

- **Step 1 Cases**: Basic science concepts, pathophysiology, pharmacology
- **Step 2 Cases**: Clinical diagnosis, management, next best steps
- **Complete Vignettes**: History, physical exam, labs, imaging
- **Multiple Choice Questions**: Single best answer format
- **Answer Explanations**: Detailed rationale for learning

## Usage

```python
# Generate a Step 1 case (pathophysiology focus)
python scripts/main.py --step 1 --topic cardiology --difficulty medium

# Generate a Step 2 case (clinical management focus)
python scripts/main.py --step 2 --topic nephrology --include-diagnosis

# Generate case with specific conditions
python scripts/main.py --step 2 --condition "diabetic ketoacidosis" --format json
```

## Example Output

```
Case: A 58-year-old male with chest pain

A 58-year-old man presents to the emergency department with 
crushing substernal chest pain radiating to his left arm, 
beginning 2 hours ago at rest...

[History, physical, labs, ECG findings...]

Question: What is the most appropriate next step in management?

A. Administer aspirin and nitroglycerin
B. Order CT pulmonary angiography

```

## Safety & Limitations

- Cases are AI-generated and may contain inaccuracies
- Not a substitute for professional medical education
- Always verify clinical details with authoritative sources
- Intended for educational purposes only

## Dependencies

- Python 3.8+
- No external API dependencies (template-based generation)
- Optional: LLM integration for case variation

## Risk Assessment

| Risk Indicator | Assessment | Level |
|----------------|------------|-------|
| Code Execution | Python/R scripts executed locally | Medium |
| Network Access | No external API calls | Low |
| File System Access | Read input files, write output files | Medium |
| Instruction Tampering | Standard prompt guidelines | Low |
| Data Exposure | Output files saved to workspace | Low |

## Security Checklist

- [ ] No hardcoded credentials or API keys
- [ ] No unauthorized file system access (../)
- [ ] Output does not expose sensitive information
- [ ] Prompt injection protections in place
- [ ] Input file paths validated (no ../ traversal)
- [ ] Output directory restricted to workspace
- [ ] Script execution in sandboxed environment
- [ ] Error messages sanitized (no stack traces exposed)
- [ ] Dependencies audited
## Prerequisites

```bash
# Python dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Evaluation Criteria

### Success Metrics
