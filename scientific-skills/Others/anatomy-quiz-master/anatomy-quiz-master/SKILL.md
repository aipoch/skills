# Anatomy Quiz Master

## Overview

Comprehensive anatomy education tool that generates interactive quizzes covering gross anatomy, neuroanatomy, and clinical anatomy with adaptive difficulty and detailed explanations.

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Regional Quizzes**: Head/neck, thorax, abdomen, pelvis, limbs
- **Multiple Question Types**: Identification, function, clinical correlation
- **Adaptive Difficulty**: Basic, intermediate, advanced levels
- **Image Integration**: Label identification with anatomical images
- **Progress Tracking**: Performance analytics and weak area identification
- **Exam Mode**: Timed simulations for USMLE-style preparation

## When to Use

**✅ Use this skill when:**
- Medical students preparing for anatomy practical exams
- Self-assessment after anatomy lectures or dissections
- Identifying weak anatomical regions for focused study
- Creating practice questions for study groups
- Remediation for students who failed anatomy assessments
- Preparing for USMLE Step 1 anatomy questions

**Integration:**
- **Upstream**: `usmle-case-generator` (clinical context), `anki-card-creator` (flashcard export)
- **Downstream**: `study-limitations-drafter` (weakness analysis), `performance-tracker` (progress monitoring)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Regional Anatomy Quizzes

Generate focused quizzes by body region:

```python
from scripts.quiz_generator import QuizGenerator

generator = QuizGenerator()

# Generate thorax quiz
quiz = generator.generate_quiz(
    region="thorax",
    topics=["heart", "lungs", "mediastinum", "thoracic_wall"],
    difficulty="intermediate",
    n_questions=20
)

# Export for LMS
quiz.export(format="json", filename="thorax_quiz.json")
```

**Supported Regions:**
| Region | Subtopics | Question Types |
|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Head & Neck** | Skull, cranial nerves, triangles, viscera | Identification, pathways, clinical |
| **Thorax** | Heart, lungs, mediastinum, pleura | Relations, auscultation, imaging |
| **Abdomen** | GI tract, retroperitoneum, vessels | Peritoneal reflections, vascular supply |
| **Pelvis** | Organs, perineum, walls | Gender differences, clinical correlations |
| **Upper Limb** | Shoulder, arm, forearm, hand | Muscle actions, innervation, clinical |
| **Lower Limb** | Hip, thigh, leg, foot | Gait, compartments, clinical exams |
| **Back** | Vertebral column, spinal cord, muscles | Levels, landmarks, clinical |

### 2. Neuroanatomy Pathway Tracing

Specialized quizzes for neural pathways:

```python
# Neuroanatomy quiz
neuro_quiz = generator.generate_neuro_quiz(
    pathway_type="motor",  # or "sensory", "cranial_nerves", "reflexes"
    include_lesions=True,
    clinical_correlations=True
)
```

**Pathway Types:**
- **Motor Pathways**: Corticospinal, corticobulbar, basal ganglia circuits
- **Sensory Pathways**: Dorsal column, spinothalamic, trigeminal
- **Cranial Nerves**: All 12 nerves with nuclei and clinical tests
- **Reflex Arcs**: Deep tendon, superficial, visceral
- **Vascular**: Arterial supply, venous drainage, stroke syndromes

### 3. Clinical Correlation Questions

Integrate anatomy with clinical scenarios:

```python
clinical_quiz = generator.generate_clinical_quiz(
    region="abdomen",
    scenario_types=["surgery", "radiology", "physical_exam"],
    difficulty="advanced"
)
```

**Question Formats:**
```
Clinical Scenario:
"A 45-year-old male presents with epigastric pain radiating to the back. 
CT shows a mass in the lesser sac."

Question: "Which artery runs immediately posterior to the body of the 
pancreas and would be at risk during resection?"

A) Splenic artery
B) Superior mesenteric artery
C) Common hepatic artery
D) Left gastric artery

Correct: B) Superior mesenteric artery

Explanation: The SMA emerges from the aorta at L1 and passes posterior 
to the neck of the pancreas and anterior to the uncinate process...
```

### 4. Adaptive Learning System

Adjust difficulty based on performance:

```python
from scripts.adaptive import AdaptiveEngine

engine = AdaptiveEngine()

# Track student performance
student_progress = engine.track_performance(
    student_id="student_001",
    quiz_results=results,
    time_per_question=True
)

# Generate personalized quiz targeting weak areas
personalized = engine.generate_adaptive_quiz(
    student_progress=student_progress,
    focus_areas=["thorax_vessels", "cranial_nerves"],
    mastery_threshold=0.80
)
```

**Adaptive Features:**
- **Spaced Repetition**: Re-test incorrect topics at optimal intervals
- **Difficulty Scaling**: Increase level after 3 consecutive correct answers
- **Time Pressure**: Gradually reduce time limits for speed practice
- **Weakness Identification**: Track performance by anatomical structure

## Common Patterns

### Pattern 1: Pre-Exam Comprehensive Review

**Scenario**: Student preparing for anatomy practical exam in 2 weeks.

```bash
# Generate full-body comprehensive quiz
python scripts/main.py \
  --mode comprehensive \
  --regions all \
  --difficulty intermediate \
  --n-questions 100 \
  --timed \
  --output pre_practice_exam.json

# Focus on weak areas identified
python scripts/main.py \
  --mode adaptive \
  --focus abdomen,pelvis \
  --difficulty advanced \
  --n-questions 30 \
  --output weak_areas_review.json
```

**Study Schedule:**
- Week 1: Comprehensive quizzes (all regions)
- Week 2: Focus on <80% score regions
- 3 days before: Timed practice exam
- Day before: Light review of marked difficult questions

### Pattern 2: Lab Session Preparation

**Scenario**: Student preparing for cadaver lab on upper limb.

```python
# Pre-lab identification quiz
pre_lab = generator.generate_image_quiz(
    region="upper_limb",
    structure_types=["muscles", "vessels", "nerves"],
    label_type="pins",  # Pin identification format
    n_questions=15
)

# Clinical correlation for post-lab
post_lab_clinical = generator.generate_clinical_quiz(
    region="upper_limb",
    clinical_types=["fractures", "nerve_injuries", "vascular"]
)
```

**Lab Integration:**
- Pre-lab: 15-minute identification quiz
- During lab: Reference key landmarks
- Post-lab: Clinical correlation quiz linking anatomy to disease

### Pattern 3: USMLE Step 1 Preparation

**Scenario**: Medical student preparing for USMLE Step 1.

```bash
# USMLE-style clinical anatomy
python scripts/main.py \
  --mode usmle \
  --clinical-focus \
  --mix-basic-advanced 70:30 \
  --n-questions 40 \
  --timed-per-question 60 \
  --output usmle_anatomy_practice.json
```

**USMLE Features:**
- Clinical vignette format
- Image-based questions (radiology, pathology)
- Two-step reasoning (identify structure → clinical implication)
- Time pressure simulation (60-90 seconds per question)

### Pattern 4: Teaching Assistant Lab Quiz

```python
# Weekly lab quiz
ta_quiz = generator.generate_ta_quiz(
    week_number=5,
    region="thorax",
    practical_stations=8,
    time_per_station=3,  # minutes
    include_prosection_images=True
)

# Auto-generate answer key
answer_key = ta_quiz.generate_answer_key(
    include_acceptable_variations=True,
    grading_rubric="partial_credit"
)
```

**TA Tools:**
- Station-based practical exam format
- Answer keys with acceptable variations
- Grading rubrics
- Performance statistics by question

## Common Pitfalls

**Content Issues:**
- ❌ **Outdated anatomical knowledge** → Teaching old terminology
  - ✅ Use current Terminologia Anatomica standards

- ❌ **Nit-picky details** → Testing obscure structures rarely clinically relevant
  - ✅ Focus on high-yield anatomy that appears in clinical practice

- ❌ **Unclear images** → Poor resolution or confusing labels
  - ✅ Use high-quality images; test label legibility at screen resolution

**Educational Issues:**
- ❌ **Questions too easy** → No learning benefit
  - ✅ Calibrate to student level; aim for 60-80% success rate

- ❌ **No clinical context** → Pure memorization without application
  - ✅ Include clinical correlation questions

- ❌ **Punitive difficulty** → Discouraging rather than challenging
  - ✅ Provide encouraging feedback; focus on improvement

**Technical Issues:**
- ❌ **Predictable patterns** → Students game the system
  - ✅ Randomize question order and distractor placement

- ❌ **No progress tracking** → Can't identify weak areas
  - ✅ Implement analytics to guide focused study
