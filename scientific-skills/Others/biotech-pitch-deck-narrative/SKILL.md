**❌ Do NOT use when:**
- Scientific conference presentations → Use technical language
- Regulatory submission documents → Use formal FDA/EMA formats
- Internal R&D team communications → Use full scientific detail
- Patent applications → Use precise legal/scientific terminology
- Patient-facing materials → Use `lay-summary-gen`

**Integration:**
- **Upstream**: `market-access-value` (commercial assessment), `competitor-trial-monitor` (competitive landscape)
- **Downstream**: `business-model-canvas` (strategy development), `investor-relations-prep` (ongoing communications)

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Science-to-Business Translation

Convert technical concepts into investor-friendly language:

```python
from scripts.narrative_engine import BiotechNarrativeEngine

engine = BiotechNarrativeEngine()

# Translate technical description
translation = engine.translate_science(
    technical_description="""
    Our proprietary AAV9-based gene therapy utilizes a codon-optimized 
    transgene under control of a liver-specific promoter to restore 
    functional enzyme in patients with MPS I deficiency.
    """,
    audience="generalist_vc",
    preserve_accuracy=True
)

print(translation.business_narrative)
# "One-time gene therapy delivering a functional copy of the missing enzyme, 
#  potentially curing MPS I rather than managing symptoms"
```

**Translation Strategies:**
| Technical Concept | Business Translation | Why It Works |
|-------------------|---------------------|--------------|
| "CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing" | "Precision genetic medicine platform" | Platform implies scalability |
| "Phase II clinical data" | "De-risked asset with human proof-of-concept" | Reduces perceived risk |
| "Off-target effects" | "Industry-leading specificity profile" | Competitive framing |
| "MOA via JAK-STAT pathway" | "Novel mechanism addressing root cause" | Value proposition |

### 2. Narrative Architecture

Structure pitch deck flow for maximum impact:

```python
# Generate complete narrative arc
narrative = engine.build_narrative(
    company_stage="series_b",
    science_type="gene_therapy",
    clinical_stage="phase_2",
    target_market="rare_disease",
    key_differentiation="one_time_cure"
)

# Access each component
print(narrative.hook)           # Opening grab
print(narrative.problem)        # Market pain point
print(narrative.solution)       # Your approach
print(narrative.traction)       # Validation to date
print(narrative.ask)            # Funding request
```

**Narrative Structure:**
1. **Hook** (30 seconds): Why this, why now, why you
2. **Problem** ($B+ market): Unmet medical need, current standard limitations
3. **Solution**: Your technology/platform, mechanism of action
4. **Traction**: Clinical data, partnerships, validation
5. **Market**: Size, competition, your advantage
6. **Team**: Track record, why you'll succeed
7. **Ask**: Funding amount, use of proceeds, milestones

### 3. Stage-Specific Optimization

Calibrate message depth for funding round:

```python
# Optimize for different stages
seed_narrative = engine.optimize_for_stage(
    base_narrative=narrative,
    stage="seed",
    focus="team_and_vision"  # Seed cares about team and big idea
)

series_a_narrative = engine.optimize_for_stage(
    base_narrative=narrative,
    stage="series_a",
    focus="proof_of_concept"  # Series A needs validation
)

ipo_narrative = engine.optimize_for_stage(
    base_narrative=narrative,
    stage="ipo",
    focus="commercial_readiness"  # IPO requires near-term revenue
)
```

**Stage Requirements:**
| Stage | Key Questions | Focus Areas |
|-------|---------------|-------------|
| **Seed** ($500K-$2M) | Can you execute? | Team, vision, early validation |
| **Series A** ($10-30M) | Does it work? | POC data, IP position, market entry |
| **Series B** ($30-75M) | Will it scale? | Phase 2/3 data, BD traction, team expansion |
| **Series C/IPO** ($100M+) | Commercial execution | Registration trials, launch prep, revenue path |

### 4. Investor Audience Calibration

Adapt tone and depth for different investor types:

```python
# Calibrate for specific investor
calibrated = engine.calibrate_for_audience(
    narrative=narrative,
    investor_type="healthcare_vc",  # vs "generalist_vc" or "pharma_corp"
    technical_depth="moderate",      # Depth of scientific detail
    risk_tolerance="high"            # Early vs late stage framing
)
```

**Investor Types:**
- **Generalist VC**: Focus on market size, business model, team pedigree
- **Healthcare VC**: Balance science rigor with commercial potential
- **Pharma BD**: Emphasize strategic fit, validation data, partnership potential
- **Public Market**: Highlight near-term catalysts, revenue projections, risk mitigation

## Common Patterns
