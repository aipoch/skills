# Paraphrasing Guide

## When to Paraphrase

Paraphrasing is recommended when:
1. Similarity score exceeds threshold (default: 70%)
2. Text contains common phrases or clichés
3. Sentence structure is too similar to source material
4. Need to adapt tone for different audiences

## Paraphrasing Strategies

### 1. Vocabulary Substitution
Replace common words with precise alternatives:
- "big problem" → "significant challenge"
- "very important" → "critically essential"
- "a lot of" → "a substantial quantity of"

### 2. Sentence Structure Changes

**Original:** The researcher conducted the experiment carefully.
**Passive:** The experiment was conducted carefully by the researcher.
**Reordered:** Carefully, the researcher conducted the experiment.

### 3. Combining/Splitting Sentences

**Original:** The data shows significant results. This indicates a strong correlation.
**Combined:** The significant results demonstrated by the data indicate a strong correlation.

### 4. Voice Transformation

Active to passive conversion reduces similarity while maintaining meaning:
- "We analyzed the data" → "The data was analyzed"
- "The study reveals" → "It was revealed by the study"

## Style Guidelines

### Academic Style
