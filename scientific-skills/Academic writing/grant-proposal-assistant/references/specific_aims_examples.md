**Project Title**: Targeting Mitochondrial Dynamics in Alzheimer's Disease Pathogenesis

### Summary

Alzheimer's disease (AD) affects 6 million Americans with no disease-modifying therapies available. Mitochondrial dysfunction is an early and persistent feature of AD, yet the mechanisms linking amyloid-β (Aβ) pathology to impaired mitochondrial dynamics remain unclear. Our preliminary data demonstrate that Aβ oligomers trigger excessive mitochondrial fission via Drp1 activation, leading to synaptic failure before neuronal death. 

We have developed a novel, blood-brain barrier-permeable Drp1 inhibitor (Drp1i-18) that rescues mitochondrial function and cognitive deficits in AD mouse models. This proposal will define the molecular mechanisms by which Aβ disrupts mitochondrial dynamics and validate Drp1 as a therapeutic target.

**Central Hypothesis**: Aβ-induced aberrant Drp1 activation drives pathological mitochondrial fission, creating a feed-forward cycle of synaptic dysfunction and neurodegeneration that can be interrupted by selective Drp1 inhibition.

### Specific Aims

**Aim 1**: Determine how Aβ oligomers activate Drp1 and trigger pathological mitochondrial fission in neurons.
- **Hypothesis**: Aβ oligomers trigger Ca²⁺ influx via NMDA receptors, activating calcineurin and Drp1 dephosphorylation at Ser637, leading to excessive fission.
- **Rationale**: Understanding the upstream signaling mechanism is essential for identifying additional intervention points and biomarkers.
- **Expected Outcome**: Definition of the Aβ→Ca²⁺→calcineurin→Drp1 signaling cascade in primary neurons and human iPSC-derived neurons.

**Aim 2**: Evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of Drp1 inhibition in AD mouse models.
- **Hypothesis**: Chronic Drp1 inhibition with Drp1i-18 will preserve mitochondrial and synaptic integrity, improving cognitive function in 5xFAD and APP/PS1 mice.
- **Rationale**: Proof-of-concept in established models is necessary before advancing to translational studies.
- **Expected Outcome**: Demonstration that pharmacological Drp1 inhibition reduces AD pathology and improves memory in two independent mouse models.

**Aim 3**: Identify mitochondrial dynamics biomarkers for AD progression and therapeutic response.
- **Hypothesis**: CSF and plasma levels of mitochondrial DNA and fission/fusion proteins will correlate with disease stage and respond to Drp1 inhibition.
- **Rationale**: Biomarkers are critical for patient stratification and monitoring treatment response in future clinical trials.
- **Expected Outcome**: A panel of mitochondrial-derived biomarkers validated in mouse models and archived human samples.

### Impact

Successful completion of these aims will (1) establish a new paradigm linking Aβ to mitochondrial dysfunction in AD, (2) validate Drp1 as a druggable target, and (3) provide biomarkers for patient selection and trial monitoring. Given the urgent need for AD therapies and our strong preliminary data, this work has high potential for rapid clinical translation.

**Project Title**: Machine Learning Prediction of Acute Kidney Injury in ICU Patients

### Summary

Acute kidney injury (AKI) occurs in 20% of ICU patients and is associated with mortality exceeding 50% when requiring dialysis. Current diagnostic methods rely on creatinine changes that lag 24-48 hours behind actual kidney damage. Early identification of at-risk patients would enable preventive interventions.

We have developed a machine learning algorithm that integrates continuous vital signs, laboratory values, and medication data from the EHR to predict AKI 12 hours before current clinical criteria. This exploratory study will validate and refine our predictive model in a multi-site ICU cohort.

**Central Hypothesis**: Integration of high-frequency physiologic data with clinical variables using deep learning will enable accurate, actionable prediction of AKI before clinical manifestation.

### Specific Aims

**Aim 1**: Validate the AKI prediction algorithm in an external ICU cohort.
- **Hypothesis**: Our algorithm will maintain >0.85 AUC-ROC for predicting Stage 2+ AKI 12 hours in advance in a cohort from three academic medical centers.
- **Rationale**: External validation is essential before clinical implementation.
- **Approach**: Retrospective validation using 50,000 ICU admissions not used in algorithm development.

**Aim 2**: Identify the most informative data elements for AKI prediction.
- **Hypothesis**: Hemodynamic patterns and medication exposures will contribute most to prediction accuracy beyond traditional laboratory values.
- **Rationale**: Understanding model features will guide clinical implementation and data collection priorities.
- **Approach**: Feature importance analysis and model ablation studies.

### Impact

If successful, this work will provide a validated, interpretable tool for AKI prediction that can be integrated into ICU workflow to enable preventive interventions and reduce morbidity and mortality from AKI.

**Project Title**: Collaborative Research: Understanding the Role of Microplastics in Freshwater Ecosystem Function

### Overview

Microplastic pollution is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems, yet we lack fundamental understanding of how these particles alter ecosystem processes. This project integrates field surveys, controlled experiments, and modeling to determine how microplastics affect microbial communities and nutrient cycling in freshwater systems.

**Research Objectives**

**Objective 1**: Quantify microplastic abundance and composition across a gradient of human disturbance in 20 Midwestern lakes.

**Objective 2**: Determine how microplastic surfaces alter microbial community composition and function using mesocosm experiments.

**Objective 3**: Develop a predictive model of microplastic impacts on lake ecosystem metabolism.

### Intellectual Merit

This research addresses a critical gap in our understanding of emerging contaminants. By linking microplastic characteristics to ecosystem function, we will advance theoretical frameworks for predicting pollutant impacts on ecosystem services.

### Broader Impacts

1. **Education**: Train 2 graduate students and 4 undergraduates in interdisciplinary research
2. **Public engagement**: Develop citizen science protocols for microplastic monitoring
3. **Policy relevance**: Results will inform EPA water quality guidelines
4. **STEM diversity**: Partnership with tribal college for summer research program

## Writing Tips for Specific Aims

### Opening Paragraph Formula
1. **Hook**: The problem (scope, impact)
2. **Gap**: What's missing/unknown
3. **Your approach**: How you'll address it
4. **Preliminary data**: Evidence you can do it

### Aim Structure
- **Bold, one-sentence aim statement**
- Hypothesis (testable prediction)
- Rationale (why this matters)
- Expected outcome (what you'll know)

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid

| Pitfall | Why It's Bad | How to Fix |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| "Aim 1: Characterize..." | Too descriptive | Include a testable hypothesis |
| 5 aims | Too ambitious | Limit to 2-3 substantive aims |
| Circular aims | Don't build on each other | Make aims independent |
| Jargon | Reviewers may not know field | Define or avoid technical terms |
| Missing outcomes | Can't assess success | State expected outcomes clearly |

### Strong Verbs for Aims
- Determine
- Elucidate
- Characterize
- Evaluate
- Test
- Define
- Identify
- Validate
- Develop
- Establish

Avoid weak verbs: "study," "investigate," "look at" - they imply descriptive rather than hypothesis-driven research.
