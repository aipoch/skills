# NIH R01 Grant Proposal Template

## Overview
The Research Project Grant (R01) is the original and historically oldest grant mechanism used by NIH. It supports a discrete, specified, circumscribed project to be performed by the named investigator(s) in an area representing specific interest and competencies based on the mission of the NIH.

### 2. Abstract (Project Description)
- 30 lines of text
- One paragraph
- Must stand alone

### 3. Specific Aims (1 page)
See specific_aims_examples.md for detailed guidance.

- Timeline

### 5. Bibliography and References
- No page limit but be concise
- Use standard citation format
- Include DOIs when available

### 6. Facilities and Resources
- Describe institutional resources
- Equipment available
- Core facilities access

### 7. Equipment
- List major items
- Justify new purchases

### 8. Budget Sections
- Direct costs by category
- Indirect costs (F&A)

### 9. Biographical Sketches (5 pages each)
- Personal statement
- Positions and honors
- Contributions to science
- Research support

### 10. Other Required Sections (if applicable)

- Human Subjects
- Select Agent Research
- Authentication of Key Resources

## Review Criteria (Scored 1-9)

1. **Significance** (1-9 scale, lower is better)
   - Does the study address an important problem?
   - Will scientific knowledge be advanced?

2. **Investigator(s)**
   - Are the PIs well-suited for the project?
   - Do they have adequate experience?

3. **Innovation**
   - Does the application challenge current research?
   - Is it novel?

4. **Approach**
   - Are the aims achievable?
   - Is the design sound?
   - Are potential problems addressed?

5. **Environment**
   - Are institutional resources adequate?
   - Is the scientific environment conducive?

## Score Interpretation
- 1 = Exceptional
- 2 = Outstanding
- 3 = Excellent
- 4 = Very Good
- 5 = Good
- 6 = Satisfactory
- 7 = Fair
- 8 = Marginal
- 9 = Poor

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Aims too ambitious** - Cannot be completed in timeframe
2. **Lack of focus** - Trying to do too much
3. **Insufficient preliminary data** - Feasibility not demonstrated
4. **Poor organization** - Hard to follow
5. **Weak significance** - Not clear why research matters
6. **Inadequate alternatives** - No Plan B for risky experiments
7. **Budget inflation** - Unrealistic costs
8. **Formatting errors** - Violating page limits or font requirements

## Timeline Considerations

- **Submission**: Typically 3 submission dates per year
- **Review**: Study section meets ~4-5 months after submission
- **Council**: Advisory council review ~2-3 months after study section
- **Earliest start date**: ~9-10 months from submission
- **Resubmission**: If not funded, can revise and resubmit

## Resubmission (A1) Strategy

1. Address ALL reviewer concerns
2. Provide point-by-point response
3. Highlight changes in margins
4. Maintain original aims if possible
5. May add new preliminary data
6. Can revise budget
