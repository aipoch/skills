# Regulatory Guidance on Eligibility Criteria

## FDA Guidance

### General Principles

The FDA emphasizes that eligibility criteria should be scientifically justified and not unnecessarily restrictive. Key principles include:

1. **Scientific Rationale**: Each exclusion criterion should have a clear scientific or safety justification
2. **Population Representation**: Trials should reflect the population that will use the drug if approved
3. **Flexibility**: Criteria should allow for clinical judgment when appropriate

### Specific FDA Guidance Documents

#### 1. Guidance for Industry: Enrichment Strategies for Clinical Trials (2019)

**Key Points**:
- **Prognostic Enrichment**: Selecting patients with higher likelihood of having disease-related events
- **Predictive Enrichment**: Selecting patients more likely to respond to treatment
- **Practical Enrichment**: Improving trial efficiency through appropriate population selection

**Relevance to Eligibility Criteria**:
- Eligibility criteria can be used for enrichment
- Must document rationale for enrichment strategy
- Consider generalizability implications

#### 2. Guidance for Industry: Collection of Race and Ethnicity Data in Clinical Trials (2016)

**Key Points**:
- FDA recommends collection of race and ethnicity data
- Eligibility criteria should not unnecessarily limit diversity
- Consider factors affecting enrollment of underrepresented groups

**Action Items**:
- Review criteria for potential bias
- Implement diversity action plans for applicable trials
- Monitor enrollment by demographic subgroups

#### 3. Guidance for Industry: Pregnant Women (2018)

**Key Points**:
- Absence of data should not default to exclusion
- Eligibility decisions should be based on risk-benefit assessment
- Consider timing of pregnancy relative to study procedures

**Revised Approach**:
- Contraception-based eligibility rather than blanket exclusion
- Individualized risk assessment
- Clear pregnancy testing and reporting requirements

#### 4. Guidance for Industry: Elderly Patients (2014)

**Key Points**:
- Upper age limits should be scientifically justified
- Elderly patients should be included in trials for drugs likely to be used in this population
- Consider age-related PK/PD differences

**Recommendations**:
- Avoid arbitrary upper age limits
- Include sufficient elderly patients for subgroup analysis
- Consider dedicated geriatric studies when appropriate

#### 5. Guidance for Industry: Renal Impairment (2020)

**Key Points**:
- Renal function criteria should be based on drug pharmacology
- Default eGFR thresholds may be overly restrictive

**Recommended Approach**:
- Base criteria on drug elimination pathway
- Consider dedicated renal impairment study if significant renal elimination
- Document rationale for chosen threshold

### FDA Review Division Specific Guidance

#### Oncology

**Oncology Center of Excellence Recommendations**:
- Minimize exclusions for prior therapies when scientifically appropriate
- Consider broader eligibility for unmet medical need indications
- Allow controlled brain metastases when feasible
- Implement Project Pragmatica principles for appropriate trials

#### Cardiovascular and Renal

**Key Considerations**:
- Include patients with common comorbidities (diabetes, CKD) unless contraindicated
- Avoid exclusions based on concomitant medications without drug interaction data
- Consider frailty assessment in addition to age

## EMA Guidance

### General Principles

The EMA's ICH E6(R2) guideline and related documents emphasize:

1. **Subject Safety**: Primary consideration in eligibility criteria
2. **Scientific Integrity**: Criteria should support study objectives
3. **Access**: Avoid unnecessary restrictions that limit generalizability

### EMA Specific Guidance

#### 1. ICH Topic E 6 (R2) Guideline for Good Clinical Practice

**Section 4.1.3 - Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria**:
- Criteria should be clearly defined
- Subject selection should ensure study population is appropriate
- Risk to subjects should be minimized

#### 2. EMA Guidance on First-In-Human Clinical Trials (2017)

**Key Points for Phase 1**:
- Healthy volunteer vs. patient population decision
- Dosing interval and stopping rules
- Risk mitigation strategies

**Eligibility Implications**:
- Conservative criteria for first-in-human studies
- Progressive expansion of criteria in subsequent cohorts

#### 3. EMA Guidance on Clinical Trials in Small Populations (2006)

**Key Points**:
- Acceptable to use less restrictive criteria in rare diseases
- Bayesian and adaptive designs may allow more flexible eligibility
- External controls may reduce need for restrictive criteria

## ICH Guidelines

### ICH E6(R2) - Good Clinical Practice

**Section 4.1.3**:
"The investigator should ensure that subjects are selected...in accordance with the protocol."

**Section 4.3.1**:
"The trial should be conducted in compliance with the protocol...and should comply with the applicable regulatory requirement(s)."

### ICH E9 - Statistical Principles

**Section 2.2.2 - Study Population**:
- Define population in protocol
- Document deviations from planned population
- Consider impact of eligibility criteria on generalizability

### ICH E17 - Multi-Regional Clinical Trials

**Considerations for Eligibility Criteria**:
- Consistent criteria across regions where possible
- Consider regional regulatory requirements
- Document rationale for any regional differences

## Regulatory Requirements for Criteria Modifications

### FDA Requirements

**Protocol Amendments**:
- Significant changes to eligibility criteria require protocol amendment
- May require IRB re-approval
- May require IND safety report if safety-related

**Criteria Changes Requiring Amendment**:
- Addition or removal of major exclusion categories
- Changes to safety-related laboratory thresholds
- Significant modifications to pregnancy-related criteria

**Administrative Changes** (may not require amendment):
- Clarifying language without substantive change
- Adding examples
- Correcting errors

### EMA Requirements

**Substantial Modifications**:
- Changes to inclusion/exclusion criteria may be substantial modifications
- Require regulatory notification
- May require updated risk-benefit assessment

## Best Practices for Regulatory Alignment

### Protocol Development Phase

1. **Early Regulatory Consultation**
   - Request pre-IND/IMPD meetings for novel criteria
   - Discuss enrichment strategies
   - Review proposed eligibility restrictions

2. **Documentation**
   - Document rationale for each criterion
   - Reference supporting literature
   - Include benefit-risk assessment

3. **Diversity Planning**
   - Develop diversity action plans for applicable trials
   - Set enrollment targets for underrepresented groups
   - Monitor and report diversity metrics

### Study Conduct Phase

1. **Deviation Management**
   - Track eligibility deviations
   - Analyze patterns
   - Consider protocol amendments if systematic issues

2. **Amendment Strategy**
   - Plan amendment triggers (e.g., screen success < 30%)
   - Prepare supporting documentation
   - Coordinate with regulatory affairs

### Reporting Requirements

**Clinical Study Reports**:
- Describe eligibility criteria in detail
- Report screen failure rates and reasons
- Include demographic subgroup analyses
- Discuss generalizability limitations
