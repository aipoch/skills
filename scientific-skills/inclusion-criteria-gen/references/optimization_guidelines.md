# Optimization Guidelines for Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria

## Overview

This document provides best practices for optimizing clinical trial eligibility criteria to balance scientific rigor with recruitment feasibility.

## General Principles

### 1. Minimize Unnecessary Exclusions

**Principle**: Every exclusion criterion should have a clear scientific or safety rationale.

**Strategies**:
- Review each exclusion to ensure it's necessary
- Consider if time-limited exclusions are appropriate (e.g., "within 6 months" vs "history of")
- Evaluate if laboratory thresholds are evidence-based

**Example**:
- ❌ "History of any cardiovascular disease"
- ✅ "Myocardial infarction or stroke within 6 months"

### 2. Use Objective Measures

**Principle**: Objective criteria reduce variability in eligibility assessment.

**Strategies**:
- Replace subjective assessments with validated scales
- Provide specific thresholds instead of vague descriptions
- Use established guidelines (e.g., eGFR calculation using CKD-EPI)

**Examples**:
- ❌ "Significant hepatic impairment"
- ✅ "Total bilirubin > 2× ULN or AST/ALT > 3× ULN"

### 3. Consider Visit Burden

**Principle**: Excessive visit requirements can limit enrollment.

**Strategies**:
- Minimize in-person visits when telemedicine is acceptable
- Allow window periods for visit timing (e.g., ±3 days)
- Combine assessments when possible
- Consider home health visits for mobility-limited patients

### 4. Address Health Literacy

**Principle**: Complex consent processes can exclude underserved populations.

**Strategies**:
- Provide consent materials in appropriate languages
- Consider health literacy levels in consent design
- Allow sufficient time for informed consent process
- Provide decision support tools when appropriate

## Therapeutic Area-Specific Guidelines

### Diabetes Trials

**HbA1c Range Optimization**:
- Standard range: 7.5% - 10.5%
- More inclusive: 7.0% - 11.0% (may increase screen success by 15-20%)
- Tighter control: 8.0% - 10.0% (for studies requiring baseline hyperglycemia)

**BMI Considerations**:
- Minimum BMI: Consider removing if not scientifically necessary
- Maximum BMI: 40-45 kg/m² is typically acceptable; >50 kg/m² may require dose adjustments

**Renal Function**:
- eGFR > 30 mL/min: Acceptable for most non-renally cleared drugs
- eGFR > 45 mL/min: Conservative threshold for renal clearance drugs
- eGFR > 60 mL/min: May unnecessarily exclude 20-30% of diabetic population

**Hypoglycemia Exclusions**:
- Consider time-limited exclusions rather than complete history
- Define "severe" using ADA criteria (requiring assistance)
- Consider allowing if on stable regimen for 6+ months

### Oncology Trials

**Performance Status**:
- ECOG 0-1: Standard for most trials
- ECOG 0-2: Consider for palliative or single-arm studies (increases eligible population by ~20%)
- ECOG 3: Generally exclude except for supportive care studies

**Prior Therapy Lines**:
- Document clear rationale for number of prior lines required
- Consider "up to X prior lines" rather than "exactly X lines"
- Allow for prior exposure to drug class in different settings

**Laboratory Parameters**:
- ANC ≥ 1.5: Standard for cytotoxic therapy
- ANC ≥ 1.0: May be acceptable for non-myelosuppressive agents
- Platelet thresholds: Balance bleeding risk with recruitment needs

**Washout Periods**:
- Cytotoxic chemotherapy: 3-4 weeks (5 half-lives)
- Immunotherapy: 4-6 weeks
- Small molecule TKIs: 5 half-lives or 2 weeks, whichever is longer

### Cardiovascular Trials

**Age Considerations**:
- Upper age limit: Consider removing if not scientifically justified
- Elderly patients (≥75): Often underrepresented despite having highest disease burden
- Frailty assessment: Consider adding to complement age criteria

**Blood Pressure Limits**:
- Systolic: 90-180 mmHg generally acceptable
- Consider individualized targets for very elderly or frail patients
- Allow for multiple measurements to account for white coat effect

**Concomitant Medications**:
- Document permitted dose ranges for background therapy
- Consider allowing dose adjustments during run-in period
- Avoid prohibiting medications commonly needed in target population

## Optimization Strategies by Enrollment Phase

### Pre-Study (Protocol Design)

1. **Pilot Testing**
   - Conduct feasibility assessments with target sites
   - Review screening logs from similar trials
   - Survey potential participants about barriers

2. **Competitive Analysis**
   - Review eligibility criteria of competing trials
   - Identify opportunities for differentiation
   - Consider harmonizing with landmark trials for comparability

3. **Site Input**
   - Engage sites in criteria development
   - Consider regional variations in practice patterns
   - Account for available diagnostic capabilities

### Early Enrollment Phase

1. **Screen Failure Analysis**
   - Track reasons for screen failure
   - Identify top 3-5 exclusion drivers
   - Calculate impact of each criterion on eligible population

2. **Protocol Amendments**
   - Consider amendments if screen success < 30%
   - Prioritize changes with high impact and low safety risk
   - Document rationale for regulatory submissions

3. **Eligibility Waivers**
   - Develop clear waiver criteria
   - Implement central review for consistency
   - Track waiver frequency and outcomes

### Late Enrollment Phase

1. **Adaptive Strategies**
   - Consider expansion cohorts with modified criteria
   - Evaluate enrichment vs. broadening strategies
   - Assess impact of modifications on primary endpoint

2. **Site Expansion**
   - Add sites in underrepresented regions
   - Consider community-based sites for real-world populations
   - Evaluate decentralized trial approaches

## Common Optimization Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Over-Optimization

**Risk**: Overly broad criteria may compromise study integrity

**Mitigation**:
- Maintain core safety exclusions
- Document scientific rationale for modifications
- Monitor for protocol deviations post-modification

### 2. Confounding by Indication

**Risk**: Relaxed criteria may introduce confounding variables

**Mitigation**:
- Adjust sample size for increased variability
- Include stratification factors
- Plan appropriate subgroup analyses

### 3. Regulatory Concerns

**Risk**: Major modifications may require regulatory notification

**Mitigation**:
- Consult regulatory affairs early
- Document benefit-risk assessment
- Consider regulatory feedback on proposed changes

## Metrics for Optimization Success

### Primary Metrics

| Metric | Target | Action Threshold |
|--------|--------|------------------|
| Screen Success Rate | > 35% | < 25% |
| Enrollment Rate | > 2 subjects/site/month | < 1 subject/site/month |
| Time to Complete Enrollment | < 120% of target | > 150% of target |

### Secondary Metrics

- **Diversity metrics**: Representation vs. disease epidemiology
- **Protocol deviations**: Rate of eligibility deviations
- **Safety signals**: Comparison pre- vs post-modification
- **Site satisfaction**: Feedback on criteria feasibility
