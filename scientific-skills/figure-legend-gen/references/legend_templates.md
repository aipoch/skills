# Figure Legend Templates

## Bar Chart Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Comparison of [METRIC] across [GROUPS]

Bar chart showing [METRIC] in [SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION]. Data are presented as mean ± SEM from n=[N] independent experiments. Statistical significance was determined by [TEST]; *p<0.05, **p<0.01, ***p<0.001. Error bars represent standard error of the mean (SEM).
```

## Line Graph Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Time course of [METRIC] in [CONDITION]

Line graph showing [METRIC] over [TIME_RANGE] in [SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION]. Data points represent mean ± SEM from n=[N] replicates per time point. Significance compared to control: *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Shaded areas indicate standard error of the mean.
```

## Scatter Plot Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Correlation between [X_VAR] and [Y_VAR]

Scatter plot showing the relationship between [X_VAR] and [Y_VAR] in [SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION]. Each point represents an individual [SAMPLE_UNIT]. n=[N]. Correlation coefficient (r) = [R_VALUE], p = [P_VALUE]. Solid line indicates linear regression fit.
```

## Box Plot Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Distribution of [METRIC] across [GROUPS]

Box plot showing [METRIC] distribution in [SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION]. Boxes represent interquartile range (IQR), lines indicate median, whiskers show 1.5×IQR. n=[N] per group. Mann-Whitney U test; *p<0.05, **p<0.01. Outliers are shown as individual points.
```

## Heatmap Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** [METRIC] matrix across [DIMENSIONS]

Heatmap displaying [METRIC] values across [DIMENSIONS]. Color scale indicates [VALUE_RANGE]. Data normalized by [NORMALIZATION_METHOD]. Hierarchical clustering performed using [CLUSTERING_METHOD].
```

## Microscopy Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** [STAINING] staining of [SAMPLE_TYPE]

Representative confocal microscopy images of [SAMPLE_TYPE] stained with [STAINS]. Scale bar: [SCALE_BAR]. Images acquired with [MICROSCOPE_TYPE]. DAPI (blue) indicates nuclei.
```

## Flow Cytometry Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Flow cytometry analysis of [MARKER]

FACS plots showing [MARKER] expression in [CELL_TYPE]. [PERCENT_POSITIVE]% of cells were positive for [MARKER]. n=[N] experiments. Gating strategy shown in supplementary figure.
```

## Western Blot Template

```markdown
**Figure X.** Western blot analysis of [PROTEIN]

Immunoblot showing [PROTEIN] expression in [SAMPLE_DESCRIPTION]. [LOADING_CONTROL] served as loading control. Representative of n=[N] experiments. Quantification shown in adjacent bar graph. Molecular weight markers (kDa) indicated on left.
