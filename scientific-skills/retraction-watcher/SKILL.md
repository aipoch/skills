# Retraction Watcher

A specialized skill for identifying retracted, corrected, or questionable papers in academic reference lists before they compromise research integrity.

## Purpose

Academic misconduct and errors can lead to paper retractions. Citing retracted work undermines research credibility. This skill:
- Scans reference lists from manuscripts, papers, or bibliographies
- Cross-checks citations against Retraction Watch and other retraction databases
- Identifies papers with retraction notices, expressions of concern, or corrections
- Provides detailed reports with retraction reasons and dates

## Trigger Conditions

Activate this skill when:
1. User provides a document with references and asks to check for retractions
2. User explicitly requests "check my references" or "scan for retracted papers"
3. User submits a bibliography or reference list for verification
4. Pre-submission manuscript review is requested
5. User wants to verify citation integrity

## Input Format

Accepted inputs:
- PDF files (manuscripts, papers, theses)
- Plain text files (.txt, .bib, .ris)
- Raw text containing reference lists
- URLs to papers or reference lists
- Clipboard content with citations

## Output Format

### Report Header
```
🔍 RETRACTION WATCH REPORT
Documents Scanned: [N]
References Found: [N]
Check Date: [YYYY-MM-DD]
```

### Status Categories

**🔴 RETRACTED** - Paper has been officially retracted
- Reason for retraction
- Retraction date
- Original DOI/PMID
- Recommended action: Remove citation

**🟡 EXPRESSION OF CONCERN** - Journal has raised concerns
- Nature of concern
- Date issued
- Recommended action: Verify current status, consider alternative sources

**🟠 CORRECTED** - Paper has published corrections/errata
- Correction details
- Date of correction
- Recommended action: Check if correction affects cited claims

**🟢 CLEAR** - No retraction issues found

## Technical Approach

### Citation Parsing Strategy
1. **Format Detection**: Identify citation style (APA, MLA, Vancouver, Chicago, etc.)
2. **Field Extraction**: Parse DOI, PMID, title, authors, journal, year
3. **Identifier Resolution**: Normalize DOIs (remove prefixes, validate format)
4. **Title Matching**: Extract article titles for fuzzy matching

### Database Checking
1. **Retraction Watch Database** - Primary source for retraction data
2. **Crossref API** - Retraction metadata via "update-type: retraction"
3. **PubMed API** - Retraction notices via publication type filters
4. **Open Retractions** - Aggregated retraction data

### Matching Algorithm
- **Exact Match**: DOI/PMID exact match (highest confidence)
- **Title Match**: Normalized title comparison (90%+ similarity threshold)
- **Author + Year**: Secondary verification for ambiguous matches
- **Fuzzy Matching**: Handle minor title variations and typos

## Difficulty Level

**Medium-High** - Requires:
- Robust citation parsing across multiple formats
- API integration with retraction databases
- Handling of partial/incomplete citation data
- Fuzzy matching for title-based lookups
- Rate limiting and caching for API calls

## Quality Criteria

A successful scan must:
- [ ] Parse >90% of citations correctly from standard formats
- [ ] Achieve <1% false positive rate on retraction detection
- [ ] Provide actionable recommendations for each flagged citation
- [ ] Handle missing DOIs/PMIDs via title matching fallback
- [ ] Complete checks within reasonable time (<30s for 50 references)
- [ ] Preserve reference numbering for easy identification

## Limitations

- Requires internet connection for database lookups
- Rate limits may apply to free API tiers
- Very recent retractions (<48 hours) may not be indexed
- Title-only matching may produce false positives with similar titles
- Non-English papers may have limited coverage
- Preprint citations (arXiv, bioRxiv) typically not tracked for retractions

## Example Usage

```python
# Check a PDF manuscript
python scripts/main.py --input manuscript.pdf --format detailed

# Check a BibTeX file
python scripts/main.py --input references.bib --output report.txt

# Check raw text
python scripts/main.py --text "[paste references here]"

# Quick check with summary only
python scripts/main.py --input paper.pdf --format summary
```
