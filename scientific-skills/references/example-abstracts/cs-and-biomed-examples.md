Title: Transformer-Based Multi-Modal Fusion for Medical Image Segmentation

Abstract
Medical image segmentation remains a challenging task due to the complexity 
of anatomical structures and the need for precise boundary detection. While 
convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have achieved remarkable success, they 
often struggle with capturing long-range dependencies. Vision Transformers 
(ViTs) have emerged as powerful alternatives but require large amounts of 
training data. In this work, we propose MedFusion-Transformer, a novel 
architecture that combines the local feature extraction capabilities of CNNs 
with the global context modeling of Transformers through a cross-attention 
mechanism.

We evaluated our approach on three publicly available datasets: BraTS 2020 
(brain tumor segmentation), LiTS (liver tumor segmentation), and ACDC 
(cardiac segmentation). Our method achieved Dice scores of 0.892 ± 0.034, 
0.856 ± 0.041, and 0.914 ± 0.028 respectively, outperforming the previous 
state-of-the-art by 2.3%, 1.8%, and 1.5%. Ablation studies demonstrate that 
the cross-attention fusion module contributes most to performance gains. 
Furthermore, our model requires 40% fewer parameters than comparable 
Transformer-based methods.

These results suggest that hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures offer a 
promising direction for medical image segmentation, particularly in 
data-scarce domains. Our code and trained models are available at 
https://github.com/example/medfusion.

## Expected Output

**Background**: Medical image segmentation faces challenges in capturing both local features and long-range dependencies, with CNNs and Transformers each having limitations.

**Objective**: To develop a hybrid architecture combining CNN local feature extraction with Transformer global context modeling for improved medical image segmentation.

**Methods**: We propose MedFusion-Transformer using cross-attention fusion, evaluated on BraTS 2020, LiTS, and ACDC datasets with Dice score metrics and ablation studies.

**Results**: Achieved Dice scores of 0.892 ± 0.034 (BraTS), 0.856 ± 0.041 (LiTS), and 0.914 ± 0.028 (ACDC), outperforming state-of-the-art by 2.3%, 1.8%, and 1.5% respectively while using 40% fewer parameters.

**Conclusion**: Hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures show promise for medical image segmentation, especially in data-scarce settings.

Title: Efficacy and Safety of Novel JAK Inhibitor XRZ-789 in Rheumatoid Arthritis: 
A Phase III Randomized Controlled Trial

Methods
This double-blind, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 482 adult patients with 
moderate-to-severe rheumatoid arthritis (RA) who had inadequate response to 
methotrexate. Participants were randomized 2:1 to receive XRZ-789 200mg daily 
(n=321) or placebo (n=161) for 24 weeks, with all patients receiving background 
methotrexate therapy. The primary endpoint was ACR20 response rate at week 24. 
Secondary endpoints included ACR50, ACR70, DAS28-CRP, and safety assessments.

Results
At week 24, ACR20 response was achieved by 68.2% (219/321) of patients in the 
XRZ-789 group versus 32.9% (53/161) in the placebo group (p<0.001, difference 
35.3%; 95% CI: 26.8-43.8). ACR50 and ACR70 responses were 42.4% versus 15.5% 
(p<0.001) and 23.7% versus 6.2% (p<0.001) respectively. Mean DAS28-CRP 
improvement was -2.1 in the XRZ-789 group versus -0.9 in placebo (p<0.001).

Adverse events occurred in 78.5% of XRZ-789 patients versus 71.4% of placebo 
patients. Serious infections were reported in 2.5% (n=8) of XRZ-789 patients 
versus 1.2% (n=2) of placebo. One case of pulmonary embolism occurred in the 
XRZ-789 group. No deaths were reported during the study period.

Conclusions
XRZ-789 demonstrated superior efficacy in treating RA patients with inadequate 
response to methotrexate, with a safety profile consistent with other JAK 
inhibitors. These findings support XRZ-789 as a new therapeutic option for 
this patient population.

## Expected Output

**Background**: Rheumatoid arthritis patients with inadequate response to methotrexate need effective alternative treatments.

**Objective**: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of XRZ-789, a novel JAK inhibitor, in patients with moderate-to-severe RA.

**Methods**: Double-blind RCT of 482 patients randomized 2:1 to XRZ-789 200mg daily (n=321) or placebo (n=161) for 24 weeks with background methotrexate. Primary endpoint: ACR20 at week 24. Secondary: ACR50/70, DAS28-CRP, safety.

**Results**: XRZ-789 achieved 68.2% ACR20 response vs 32.9% placebo (p<0.001, difference 35.3%; 95% CI: 26.8-43.8). ACR50: 42.4% vs 15.5%, ACR70: 23.7% vs 6.2% (both p<0.001). DAS28-CRP improvement: -2.1 vs -0.9 (p<0.001). Serious infections: 2.5% vs 1.2%. One pulmonary embolism in treatment group. No deaths.

**Conclusion**: XRZ-789 demonstrated superior efficacy with a safety profile consistent with other JAK inhibitors, supporting it as a new RA treatment option.
