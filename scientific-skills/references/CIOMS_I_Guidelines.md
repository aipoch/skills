# CIOMS I: International Reporting of Adverse Drug Reactions

## Overview

The CIOMS (Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences) Form I provides a standardized format for the exchange of individual case safety reports (ICSRs) between pharmaceutical companies and regulatory authorities worldwide.

## Key Components

### 1. Administrative Information
- Case identifier
- Report date
- Primary source (reporter) information
- Type of report (initial/follow-up)

### 2. Patient Information
- Age (at time of event)
- Sex
- Weight and height (if relevant)
- Special populations (pregnancy, elderly, pediatric)

### 3. Suspect Drug(s)
- Name (proprietary or established)
- Dose, frequency, route
- Therapy dates (start/stop)
- Indication
- Batch/lot number

### 4. Adverse Event
- Description of reaction
- Onset date
- Outcome
- Seriousness criteria

### 5. Other Relevant Information
- Concomitant medications
- Medical history
- Diagnostic test results
- Dechallenge/Rechallenge results

## Narrative Writing Guidelines

### Structure
The narrative should tell a complete story in chronological order:
1. Who (patient demographics)
2. Why (medical history, indication)
3. What (suspect drug)
4. When (therapy dates, event onset)
5. What happened (event description)
6. How it was managed (treatment)
7. Outcome

### Language Requirements
- Use clear, concise medical English
- Avoid abbreviations (unless standard medical terms)
- Use MedDRA preferred terms for events
- Include temporal relationships explicitly
- State facts, avoid speculation

### Critical Elements to Include
- Time to onset from first dose
- Dechallenge information (did event resolve after stopping drug?)
- Rechallenge information (did event recur on re-exposure?)
- Alternative etiologies considered
- Relevant laboratory abnormalities

### Elements to Exclude
- Patient identifiers (names, initials, medical record numbers)
- Reporter contact details (in narrative)
- Company confidential information
- Speculative statements without evidence

## Seriousness Criteria (ICH E2A)

An adverse event is considered serious if it results in:
- Death
- Life-threatening
- Hospitalization (initial or prolonged)
- Disability/incapacity
- Congenital anomaly/birth defect
- Other medically important condition

## Causality Assessment Categories

| Category | Definition |
|----------|------------|
| Certain | Event occurs with plausible time relationship, cannot be explained by disease/other drugs, confirmed by dechallenge/rechallenge |
| Probable/Likely | Reasonable time sequence, unlikely to be attributed to disease/other drugs, response to withdrawal clinically reasonable |
| Possible | Reasonable time sequence, could also be explained by disease/other drugs |
| Unlikely | Time relationship implausible, disease/other drugs provide plausible explanation |
| Conditional/Unclassified | More data required for assessment |
| Unassessable/Unclassifiable | Insufficient information to assess |
