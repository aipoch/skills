# NIH Scoring Rubric Reference

## Overview

The NIH peer review process uses a 1-9 scoring scale where **lower scores are better**. This inverted scale reflects the reviewer's enthusiasm level, with 1 indicating exceptional merit and 9 indicating poor quality.

## Overall Impact Score (1-9)

The Overall Impact Score is the single most important output of the review process. It reflects the reviewer's assessment of the likelihood that the project will exert a sustained, powerful influence on the research field.

### Score Descriptors

| 2 | Outstanding | Outstanding merit, very likely to advance field | High (Top 5%) |
| 3 | Excellent | Excellent quality, strong scientific merit | Good (Top 10%) |
| 4 | Very Good | Very good quality, minor weaknesses | Moderate (Top 20%) |
| 5 | Good | Good quality, some weaknesses | Low-Moderate (~35%) |
| 6 | Satisfactory | Satisfactory, but significant weaknesses | Low (~50%) |
| 7 | Fair | Fair, major weaknesses present | Very Low (~70%) |
| 8 | Marginal | Marginal merit, serious deficiencies | Unlikely (~85%) |
| 9 | Poor | Poor quality, fatal flaws | Not Fundable (~95%) |

### 4. Approach

**Definition**: Are the overall strategy, methodology, and analyses well-reasoned and appropriate to accomplish the specific aims of the project? Have the investigators included plans to address weaknesses in the rigor of prior research that serves as the key support for the proposed project? Have the investigators presented strategies to ensure a robust and unbiased approach, as appropriate for the work proposed? Are potential problems, alternative strategies, and benchmarks for success presented? If the project is in the early stages of development, will the strategy establish feasibility and will particularly risky aspects be managed? For applications involving human subjects but not clinical trials, are plans to address 1) rigor of prior research, 2) rigor of proposed research, and 3) consideration of relevant biological variables described?

## Scoring Best Practices

1. **Score the Application, Not the Idea**: Score what is actually written, not what you wish was proposed
2. **Score Relative to the Field**: Consider what is standard in the specific research area
3. **Be Consistent**: Use the same standards across all applications in a review session
4. **Justify Scores**: Critique must support the assigned score
5. **Consider All Criteria**: Overall Impact is informed by, but not an average of, criterion scores
6. **Weight Appropriately**: Approach is typically the most heavily weighted criterion

## Scoring Pitfalls to Avoid

1. **Score Compression**: Avoid clustering all scores in 4-6 range
2. **Halo Effect**: Don't let one strong/weak criterion disproportionately influence others
3. **Leniency Bias**: Don't inflate scores to be "nice"
4. **Severity Bias**: Don't default to low scores without justification
5. **Inconsistency**: Maintain consistent standards across applications

## Impact of Scores on Funding

### Typical Paylines (Approximate, Vary by IC and Year)

- **NCI**: ~10th percentile (score ~25-30)
- **NIGMS**: ~25th percentile (score ~35-40)
- **NIAID**: ~15th percentile (score ~30-35)
- **NHLBI**: ~20th percentile (score ~30-35)
- **NINDS**: ~15th percentile (score ~25-30)

Note: Overall Impact scores are converted to percentiles for funding decisions. The conversion depends on the study section and review cycle.

## Score-to-Percentile Conversion

While exact conversion varies by study section, approximate mappings:

| Score Range | Approximate Percentile | Funding Likelihood |
|-------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 10-20 | 1-5% | Excellent |
| 21-30 | 6-15% | Very Good |
| 31-40 | 16-30% | Good |
| 41-50 | 31-45% | Moderate |
| 51-60 | 46-60% | Low |
| 60+ | 60%+ | Unlikely |

Note: Raw criterion scores (1-9 each) are combined algorithmically to produce the Overall Impact score (10-90 range before percentile conversion).
