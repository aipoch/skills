## Section-Specific Templates

### Resume and Summary Template (High Score Example)

```
This application from Dr. Smith at University Medical Center proposes to 
investigate the molecular mechanisms of disease X using innovative single-cell
approaches. The PI has an exceptional track record in this area with highly
cited publications in top-tier journals. Preliminary data are compelling and
strongly support the central hypothesis. The team includes excellent 
collaborators with complementary expertise. The approach is rigorous and well-
designed, with appropriate attention to potential pitfalls. The major strength
is the combination of an important clinical question with novel methodology.
Minor concerns about the generalizability of findings do not substantially
diminish enthusiasm for this highly significant and innovative proposal.
```

### Resume and Summary Template (Medium Score Example)

```
This application from Dr. Jones at State University aims to characterize
protein Y in disease Z. The PI is well-qualified with relevant training and
publications. The research question is of moderate significance to the field.
Preliminary data support the feasibility of Aim 1, but are lacking for Aim 2.
The approach is generally sound but the statistical analysis plan is under-
developed. Innovation is limited as the methods are largely standard. The major
weakness is the lack of preliminary data for the second aim, which diminishes
confidence in the project's overall feasibility. If funded, this project could
make a useful contribution to the field.
```

### Resume and Summary Template (Low Score Example)

```
This application from Dr. Brown at Regional College proposes to study gene A in
disease B using a conventional approach. While the PI has some relevant 
experience, the track record in this specific area is limited. The significance
of the proposed research is unclear as the connection to human disease is 
tenuous. The aims are overly ambitious for the proposed timeframe and 
insufficient preliminary data are presented to support feasibility. The 
approach lacks innovation and important experimental controls are missing. 
Major concerns about investigator qualifications, significance, and approach
derive enthusiasm for this application.

## Narrative Critique Templates by Score Level

### Significance Narratives

**Score 1-2 (Exceptional/Outstanding)**:
```
The proposed research addresses a critical barrier to progress in the field.
The research question is of high clinical significance with clear potential to
impact patient care. The applicant has clearly articulated a significant 
knowledge gap that, when filled, will substantially advance the field. The 
potential for transformative impact is high.
```

**Score 3-4 (Excellent/Very Good)**:
```
The application addresses an important research question with clear relevance
to human health. The knowledge gap is reasonably well-articulated, though 
could be more explicitly stated. The significance would be strengthened by a
more direct connection to clinical outcomes.
```

**Score 5-6 (Good/Satisfactory)**:
```
The proposed research addresses a question of moderate significance. While the
research may advance scientific understanding, the impact on the field and 
clinical relevance are limited. The knowledge gap is not clearly distinguished
from what is already known.
```

**Score 7-9 (Fair/Poor)**:
```
The significance of the proposed research is unclear. The problem is either
not important or has already been adequately addressed by others. The 
applicant has not made a compelling case that filling this knowledge gap will
advance the field or benefit human health.
```

### Investigator Narratives

**Score 1-2 (Exceptional/Outstanding)**:
```
The PI is exceptionally well-qualified for the proposed research with a 
distinguished track record of high-impact publications in this area. The team
is ideally constituted with all necessary expertise represented. The PI's
commitment of X% effort is appropriate and supported by institutional 
documentation.
```

**Score 3-4 (Excellent/Very Good)**:
```
The PI is well-qualified for the proposed research with relevant training and
a good publication record. The assembled team includes appropriate 
collaborators. The time commitment appears adequate for the proposed work.
```

**Score 5-6 (Good/Satisfactory)**:
```
The PI has adequate qualifications but there are some concerns about specific
expertise in [METHOD]. The team would benefit from additional expertise in
[AREA]. The PI's effort allocation appears reasonable.
```

**Score 7-9 (Fair/Poor)**:
```
The PI lacks the necessary qualifications and experience for the proposed
research. The track record does not demonstrate the ability to successfully
execute the proposed aims. Critical expertise is missing from the team.
```

### Approach Narratives

**Score 1-2 (Exceptional/Outstanding)**:
```
The research design is rigorous and appropriate for the stated aims. The
experimental approach is well-integrated and builds logically from the
preliminary data. Potential pitfalls are thoroughly considered and excellent
alternative approaches are described. The statistical analysis plan is 
appropriate and well-justified.
```

**Score 3-4 (Excellent/Very Good)**:
```
The approach is sound and should enable the aims to be achieved. Preliminary
data adequately support feasibility. Pitfalls are identified with reasonable
alternatives proposed. The analysis plan is generally appropriate, though 
could be more fully developed.
```

**Score 5-6 (Good/Satisfactory)**:
```
The approach has significant weaknesses that diminish confidence in the 
project's feasibility. Preliminary data are insufficient to support key 
aspects of the proposed work. Some potential pitfalls are not adequately 
addressed. The statistical analysis plan requires further development.
```

**Score 7-9 (Fair/Poor)**:
```
The approach is not well-developed and has fatal flaws. Preliminary data are
grossly inadequate. The experimental design is weak with important controls
missing. No adequate alternatives are presented for high-risk elements.
```

## Tone Guidelines

### Professional and Objective
- Use neutral, factual language
- Avoid emotional or judgmental terms
- Focus on the science, not the scientist

### Specific and Actionable
- Provide specific locations of issues
- Suggest specific improvements
- Avoid vague criticism

### Constructive
- Balance strengths with weaknesses
- Suggest alternatives when criticizing
- Acknowledge good aspects even in weak proposals

### Examples of Phrasing

**Instead of**: "The PI doesn't know what they're doing"
**Use**: "The PI's experience does not appear adequate for the proposed methodology"

**Instead of**: "This is a terrible idea"
**Use**: "The significance of the proposed research is unclear"

**Instead of**: "The methods are completely wrong"
**Use**: "The proposed approach has significant limitations that reduce confidence in the ability to achieve the aims"
