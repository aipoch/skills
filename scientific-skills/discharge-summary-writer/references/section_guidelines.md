# Section Writing Guidelines

## 1. Chief Complaint (主诉) Guidelines

### Examples

- ✅ "Fever and cough for 5 days" / "发热伴咳嗽5天"
- ❌ "Patient feels unwell" (too vague)
- ❌ "Multiple complaints" (not specific)

### Tips
- Use patient's own words when appropriate
- Include duration in specific terms (hours, days, weeks)
- Keep under 20 words if possible
- Focus on the most significant symptom

## 2. Present Illness History (现病史) Guidelines

### Required Elements (OPQRST+AAA Framework)

- **R** - Radiation: Does it spread to other areas?
- **S** - Severity: Pain scale 0-10 or impact on function
- **T** - Timing: Constant, intermittent, frequency
- **A** - Associated symptoms
