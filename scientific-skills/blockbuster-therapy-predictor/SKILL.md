# Blockbuster Therapy Predictor

**ID**: 202

## Function Overview

Combine clinical trial data, patent landscape, and early-stage VC funding data to predict which early-stage technology pathways (such as PROTAC, mRNA, gene editing, etc.) are likely to become the next "blockbuster" therapy.

## Data Dimensions

### 1. Clinical Trials Data
- Trial phase distribution (Phase I/II/III)
- Indication coverage breadth
- Trial success rates and timelines
- Key clinical endpoint achievement

### 2. Patent Landscape Data
- Patent application trends and growth rates
- Technology moat depth (number of core patents)
- Patent family geographic coverage
- Major player layout density

### 3. Funding Data (VC Funding)
- Early-stage funding rounds and amounts
- Investor quality (top-tier VC participation)
- Funding frequency and valuation growth
- Time from company founding to funding

## Technology Pathway Assessment Model

### Maturity Score
```
Maturity = 0.4 × Clinical_Stage + 0.3 × Patent_Depth + 0.3 × Funding_Stage
```

### Market Potential Score
```
Market_Potential = 0.35 × Addressable_Market + 0.35 × Unmet_Need + 0.30 × Competitive_Landscape
```

### Blockbuster Index
```
Blockbuster_Index = 0.5 × Market_Potential + 0.3 × Maturity + 0.2 × Momentum
```

## Output Format

### 1. Technology Pathway Ranking Table
| Rank | Technology Pathway | Blockbuster Index | Maturity | Market Potential | Investment Recommendation |
|------|----------|--------------|--------|----------|----------|

### 2. Detailed Assessment Report
- Technology pathway overview
- Key driving factors
- Risk factors
- Timeline prediction

### 3. Investment Recommendations
- **Strongly Recommended**: Index ≥ 80
- **Recommended**: Index 60-79
- **Watch**: Index 40-59
- **Cautious**: Index < 40

## Usage

```bash
# Run full analysis
python skills/blockbuster-therapy-predictor/scripts/main.py --mode full
