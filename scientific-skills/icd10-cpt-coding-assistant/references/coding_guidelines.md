# Medical Coding Guidelines

## General Principles

### ICD-10-CM Coding

1. **Code to Highest Specificity**
   - Use all characters available for the code
   - Never code "unspecified" when more specific information is available
   - Verify 7th character extensions for certain categories (injuries, pregnancy)

2. **Primary Diagnosis Selection**
   - Code first the condition primarily responsible for the encounter
   - Principal diagnosis is defined as the condition after study that occasioned the admission
   - For outpatient visits, the chief complaint drives the primary diagnosis

3. **Chronic Conditions**
   - Code all documented conditions that coexist at the time of the encounter
   - Chronic conditions treated or affecting treatment should be coded
   - Do not code conditions that no longer exist

4. **Signs and Symptoms**
   - Code signs and symptoms when a definitive diagnosis has not been established
   - Do not code signs/symptoms routinely associated with a disease when that disease is coded

5. **Z Codes (Status Codes)**
   - Use Z codes for:
     - Health screenings
     - Status codes (e.g., Z79.4 Long-term insulin use)
     - History codes (e.g., Z87.891 Personal history of nicotine dependence)
     - Aftercare codes
     - Birth status codes

### CPT Coding

1. **E/M Code Selection**
   - Based on Medical Decision Making (MDM) OR Total Time
   - MDM components:
     - Number and complexity of problems addressed
     - Amount and/or complexity of data reviewed
     - Risk of complications and/or morbidity/mortality

2. **New vs. Established Patient**
   - **New Patient**: No face-to-face service by same physician/specialty in past 3 years
   - **Established Patient**: Has received face-to-face service by same physician/specialty in past 3 years

3. **Documentation Requirements**
   - Medical necessity must be documented
   - Chief complaint required for all encounters
   - History, exam, and MDM must support the code level

4. **Modifiers**
   - **Modifier 25**: Significant, separately identifiable E/M service on same day as procedure
   - **Modifier 59**: Distinct procedural service
   - **Modifier 91**: Repeat clinical diagnostic laboratory test

## Common Coding Scenarios

### Hypertension
- **I10**: Essential (primary) hypertension
- **I11.9**: Hypertensive heart disease without heart failure
- **I12.9**: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease without heart failure
- **I15.0**: Renovascular hypertension

### Diabetes
- **E11.9**: Type 2 diabetes without complications
- **E11.65**: Type 2 diabetes with hyperglycemia
- **E11.40**: Type 2 diabetes with diabetic neuropathy, unspecified
- **E11.21**: Type 2 diabetes with diabetic nephropathy
- **Z79.4**: Long-term use of insulin (add when applicable)

### Office Visits (Established Patient)
- **99211**: Minimal visit, usually nurse only
- **99212**: Straightforward MDM, self-limited problem
- **99213**: Low MDM, stable chronic conditions
- **99214**: Moderate MDM, worsening conditions, new problems
- **99215**: High MDM, severe problems, complex decisions

## Confidence Scoring

### High Confidence (0.90-1.00)
- Specific diagnosis with clear documentation
- Well-defined procedure with standard indication
- Complete documentation supporting code selection

### Medium Confidence (0.70-0.89)
- Good documentation with some interpretation required
- Code selection based on time or MDM, but both not clearly documented
- Minor ambiguity in clinical documentation

### Low Confidence (<0.70)
- Incomplete documentation
- Multiple possible code interpretations
- Insufficient information to support code selection

## Quality Assurance

1. **Pre-submission Review**
   - Verify code accuracy and specificity
   - Check modifier appropriateness
   - Ensure documentation supports codes billed

2. **Common Errors to Avoid**
   - Coding from the problem list without current relevance
   - Using unspecified codes when specific information available
   - Incorrect sequencing of diagnosis codes
   - Upcoding or downcoding E/M services
   - Missing modifiers when required

3. **Compliance Considerations**
   - Ensure medical necessity is documented
   - Follow payer-specific guidelines
   - Maintain audit trail of coding decisions
