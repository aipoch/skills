# ICD-10-CM Official Coding Guidelines

## Overview

ICD-10-CM (International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification) is the standardized system used for diagnosis coding in healthcare settings in the United States.

## Key Coding Principles

### 1. Code to the Highest Level of Specificity

Always select the most specific code available that accurately describes the patient's condition.

**Example:**
- ❌ E11 - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (too general)
- ✅ E11.42 - Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy (specific)

### 2. Principal Diagnosis Selection

The principal diagnosis is defined as:
- The condition established after study to be chiefly responsible for admission
- Must be reported in the first-listed position on outpatient claims

### 3. Complications and Comorbidities (CC/MCC)

Certain diagnoses may affect DRG assignment and reimbursement:
- **CC (Complication/Comorbidity)**: Increases resource utilization
- **MCC (Major CC)**: Significantly increases resource utilization

### 4. Coding Conventions

#### Alphabetic Index and Tabular List
Always use both the Alphabetic Index and Tabular List when selecting codes:
1. First, locate the main term in the Alphabetic Index
2. Then verify the code in the Tabular List

#### Includes Notes
Terms following the word "Includes" define the content of the category.

#### Excludes Notes
- **Excludes1**: Never code together (mutually exclusive)
- **Excludes2**: Not included here, but can be coded together if present

### 5. Code-First and Use-Additional-Code Notes

Some conditions require multiple codes:

**Example - Diabetes with manifestations:**
- Code first: Specific type of diabetes (E08-E13)
- Code also: Specific manifestation

```
E11.42 Type 2 diabetes mellitus with diabetic polyneuropathy
└─ E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes) + manifestation code
```

## Chapter-Specific Guidelines

### Chapter 4: Endocrine, Nutritional and Metabolic Diseases (E00-E89)

#### Diabetes Mellitus (E08-E13)

**Type 1 vs Type 2:**
- E10.- : Type 1 diabetes (insulin-dependent, juvenile-onset)
- E11.- : Type 2 diabetes (non-insulin-dependent, adult-onset)

**Common Manifestations:**
- Diabetic nephropathy: E11.21
- Diabetic retinopathy: E11.31-
- Diabetic neuropathy: E11.40-E11.44
- Diabetic foot ulcer: E11.621

**Guidelines:**
1. Code first the specific type of diabetes
2. Code manifestations separately if combination code not available
3. Use Z79.4 for long-term insulin use in Type 2 diabetes

### Chapter 9: Diseases of Circulatory System (I00-I99)

#### Hypertension (I10-I16)

**Categories:**
- I10: Essential (primary) hypertension
- I11.-: Hypertensive heart disease
- I12.-: Hypertensive chronic kidney disease
- I13.-: Hypertensive heart and chronic kidney disease
- I15.-: Secondary hypertension

**Guidelines:**
- I10 is default for hypertension without specified type
- Use additional codes for heart disease or CKD stage

#### Heart Failure (I50.-)

**Types:**
- I50.1: Left ventricular failure
- I50.20-I50.23: Systolic heart failure
- I50.30-I50.33: Diastolic heart failure
- I50.40-I50.43: Combined systolic and diastolic

### Chapter 10: Respiratory Diseases (J00-J99)

#### COPD and Asthma (J44-J45)

**COPD (J44.-):**
- J44.0: COPD with acute lower respiratory infection
- J44.1: COPD with acute exacerbation
- J44.9: COPD, unspecified

**Asthma (J45.-):**
- J45.2-: Mild intermittent
- J45.3-: Mild persistent
- J45.4-: Moderate persistent
- J45.5-: Severe persistent
- J45.9-: Unspecified

**Guidelines:**
- Use additional code to identify infection with J44.0
- Document severity and control status for asthma

### Chapter 5: Mental Disorders (F01-F99)

#### Depression (F32-F33)

**F32.-: Depressive Episode (Single)**
- F32.0: Mild
- F32.1: Moderate
- F32.2: Severe without psychotic features
- F32.3: Severe with psychotic features
- F32.9: Unspecified

**F33.-: Major Depressive Disorder (Recurrent)**
- Similar severity classification as F32

## Coding Best Practices

### Documentation Requirements

For accurate coding, documentation should include:
1. **Laterality**: Right, left, bilateral (when applicable)
2. **Severity**: Acute, chronic, mild, moderate, severe
3. **Etiology**: Cause or origin of condition
4. **Anatomical location**: Specific body part affected
5. **Episode of care**: Initial encounter, subsequent, sequelae

### Common Coding Errors

1. **Unspecified codes**: Using when more specific code available
2. **Missing manifestation codes**: Failing to code complications
3. **Incorrect sequencing**: Wrong order of multiple diagnoses
4. **Outdated codes**: Using deleted or revised codes
5. **Incomplete documentation**: Missing required specificity

### External Cause Codes (V00-Y99)

Use when documenting:
- Cause of injury/poisoning
- Place of occurrence
- Activity at time of event
- Status (civilian, military, etc.)

**Example:**
- W10.1XXA: Fall from stairs, initial encounter
- Y92.014: Kitchen of single-family home as place

## Quality Improvement

### Coding Accuracy Metrics

1. **Case Mix Index (CMI)**: Average DRG weight
2. **CMI Impact**: Financial impact of coding changes
3. **Denial Rate**: Percentage of coded claims denied
4. **Query Rate**: Number of physician queries per case

### Documentation Improvement

Strategies for better coding:
- Clinical documentation improvement (CDI) programs
- Physician education on documentation requirements
- Concurrent coding and review
- Regular coding audits
