# Alumni Career Tracker (ID: 186)

## Overview

Analyzes the career destinations of past lab graduates (industry vs academia) to help new students with career planning.

## Use Cases

- Understanding lab graduate career trajectories when new students enroll
- Statistics on industry vs academia distribution ratio
- Identifying popular industry directions and companies
- Tracking academic institutions and research areas
- Providing data support for career planning

## Data Structure

### Input: Alumni Record

```json
{
  "name": "Zhang San",
  "graduation_year": 2023,
  "degree": "PhD|Master|Bachelor",
  "current_status": "industry|academia|startup|other",
  "organization": "Company/School Name",
  "position": "Position/Title",
  "location": "City/Country",
  "field": "Research Area/Industry Direction",
  "salary_range": "optional: Salary Range",
  "notes": "Additional Information"
}
```

### Output: Career Analysis Report

```json
{
  "summary": {
    "total_alumni": 100,
    "industry_ratio": 0.65,
    "academia_ratio": 0.25,
    "startup_ratio": 0.07,
    "other_ratio": 0.03
  },
  "by_degree": {
    "PhD": { "industry": 30, "academia": 20 },
    "Master": { "industry": 25, "academia": 5 },
    "Bachelor": { "industry": 10, "academia": 0 }
  },
  "top_companies": [...],
  "top_academic_institutions": [...],
  "trend_by_year": [...],
  "recommendations": [...]
}
```

## Usage

### Command Line

```bash
# Add alumni record
python scripts/main.py add --name "Zhang San" --year 2023 --degree PhD --status industry --org "Google" --position "Research Scientist"

# Batch import
cat alumni.json | python scripts/main.py import

# Generate analysis report
python scripts/main.py analyze --output report.json

# Filter by year
python scripts/main.py analyze --year-from 2020 --year-to 2024

# Visualization report
python scripts/main.py visualize --output chart.png
```

### Python API

```python
from skills.alumni_career_tracker.scripts.main import AlumniTracker

tracker = AlumniTracker(data_path="alumni.json")

# Add record
tracker.add_alumni({
    "name": "Zhang San",
    "graduation_year": 2023,
    "degree": "PhD",
    "current_status": "industry",
    "organization": "Google",
    "position": "Research Scientist"
})

# Generate report
report = tracker.analyze()
print(report.to_json())

# Get recommendations for new student
recs = tracker.get_recommendations(degree="PhD", interest="AI")
```
